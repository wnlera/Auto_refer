The primary goal of the society was to promote and disseminate the knowledge and understanding acquired by its members, and to strengthen interactions between them. Since then, the society holds its annual meeting every year in Eilat during the month of December. At these annual meetings the senior Israeli neurobiologists, their teams, and their graduate students, as well as foreign scientists and students, present their recent research findings in platform and poster presentations. The meeting also offers the opportunity for the researchers to exchange information with each other, often leading to the initiation of collaborative studies. Both the number of members of the society and of those participating in the annual meeting is constantly increasing, and it is anticipated that this year about 600 scientists will convene at the Princess Hotel in Eilat, Israel.</p><p>Further information concerning the Israel Society for Neuroscience can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.isfn.org.il">http://www.isfn.org.il</ext-link>.</p><p>

and astrocytes. It has been well accepted that neurons expressing
the neuronal form of NOS (nNOS) are capable of
rapid release of small amounts of NO serving as a neurotransmitter.
On the other hand, astrocytic NO production
has been demonstrated mainly as a slow reaction to various
stress stimuli such as ischemia or inflammation, through the
activity of an inducible NOS isoform (iNOS). Previous data
from our laboratory described for the first time rapid astrocytic
NO release in brains of healthy animals. To further explore
the role of astrocytic-produced NO, we examined the
iNOS knockout (KO) mouse. In this mutant, the fragment
containing the calmodulin-binding domain of iNOS is replaced
by the neomycin resistance gene. Homozygous KO
mice are born with expected frequency and display no abnormalities
except for increased susceptibility to systemic infections.
NO-imaging and biochemical NOS enzymatic assay
revealed compensatory NOS activity in mutants' neocortex.
To test whether neuronal networks were modified by
the mutation, we compared the performance of KO mice to
their WT controls on basic behavioral tests. The motor activity
and explorative behavior of the KO mice were identical
to their controls on the hole-board and open-field tests.
However, KO mice revealed highly significant differences in
the parameters which indicate increased anxiety levels: thus,
grooming during open-field and hole-board tests was almost
completely suppressed in KO compared to WT mice. In the
Elevated-Plus maze, KO mice fully avoided the open arms
and exhibited lower number of stretch/attend postures. Furthermore,
they showed increased freezing when placed in the
center of the Open-Field and ventured less into the center
of the field than the WT controls. The existence of a distinct
behavioral phenotype in the iNOS KO mouse supports the
idea that astrocytic-produced NO participates in Modulating
neuronal function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e182" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TO WHAT EXTENT CAN PIGEONS LEARN NEW CATEGORIES?</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adam</surname><given-names>R. </given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="a3">

within a class of stimuli and to discriminate between
the classes. Pigeons are also capable of discriminating natural
concepts such as &#x0201c;Human&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;Fish.&#x0201d; The learning was
amazingly fast but it is unclear to what extent pigeons are
really able to establish abstract concepts or even categories.
To address this problem, we used a novel complex and artificial
category, with no previously functional relevance for the
birds to prevent embedded conceptual knowledge. We chose
the category &#x0201c;Pikachu,&#x0201d; the main character in Pokmon, a
kids fantasy world created by Nintendo. Go stimuli are characterized
by the presence of the character &#x0201c;Pikachu.&#x0201d; Other
Pok&#x000e9;mon characters appeared in Go's and NoGo's. They appeared
in various sizes and angles, and could be only partially
shown. Four pigeons were trained in a standard Go-NoGo
task. In each session a mean of 20 Go's and 20 NoGo's were
drawn randomly from a larger set. The traditional rho value
was used to compare performances. 48 &#x000b1; 20 sessions were required
till reaching the criterion of rho = 0.85 in three consecutive
sessions. A transfer test examined the subjects' ability
to generalize beyond the known examples. In each transfer
session 12 new stimuli were embedded in 40 old training
stimuli. Two transfer procedures were conducted. Two
pigeons had 5 transfer sessions with 64 new nonreinforced,
repeated transfer stimuli. The other birds were trained in
six sessions with a total number of 68 reinforced and thus
unrepeated transfer stimuli. The mean performances were
rho = 0.694 &#x000b1; 0.15, 0.581 &#x000b1; 0.17 for the two groups, respectively.
This indicated that categorization of &#x0201c;Pikachu,&#x0201d; as a
novel artificial and complex 2D category was not achieved
although the animals could memorize a larger number of
highly complex stimuli. Past exposure could play a role in
previous categorical learning by pigeons. An open question
is how crucial the language component is to novel concept
discrimination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e233" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ACTIVITY-INDUCED LONG-TERM POST-BURST AHP REDUCTION IS OCCLUDED BY LEARNING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adelstein</surname><given-names>H. </given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cohen-Matsliah</surname><given-names>S. </given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Barkai</surname><given-names>E. </given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Departments of Biology and Neurobiology, Faculty of

induced reduction in the post-burst afterhyperpolarization
(AHP) in piriform cortex pyramidal layer II pyramidal neurons.
Although much effort has been made to identify such
learning-related long-term modifications in intrinsic neuronal
properties, and explore their functional significance,
the cellular mechanisms by which these modifications are
induced are yet to be described. In brain slice preparation,
it has been shown that intense activation of glutamatergic
synapses receptors induces long-lasting reduction of the AHP
and enhanced neuronal excitability in a kainite-receptor dependent
process.Here we examine whether learning-induced
reduction of the post burst AHP occludes subsequent reduction
of the AHP by repetitive synaptic activation. Rats
were trained in an olfactory discrimination task to distinguish
between positive and negative odor cues until they
demonstrated rule learning. Intracellular recordings from piriofm cortex layer II pyramidal neurons were performed
three days after training completion. Twenty stimuli, at frequency
of 50 Hz, were applied to the intrinsic fibers (layer
Ib), after stimulus intensity was adjusted to evoke a 10 mV
PSP in the recorded neuron. Within 60 minutes after application
of repetitive stimulation, the averaged AHP value
in four neurons from control rats was significantly reduced
from 7.48 mV to 4.00 mV (<italic>n</italic> = 6, P &#x0003c; .01). The same treatment
had no effect on four neurons for trained rats (from
averaged values 4.83 mV before stimulation to 5.04 mV 60
minutes after stimulation, <italic>n</italic> = 5). Consequently, sixty minutes
after stimuli, the averaged amplitudes of neurons from
control and trained rats did not differ for each other. The
data support the notion the learning-induced long lasting reduction
of the post-burst AHP id triggered by intense glutamatergic
release that occurs due intense synaptic activation

A common consent is that certain personality traits may
render individual's vulnerability to stress and to pathological
reaction that may follow it. For example, elevated levels
of neuroticism were found significantly associated with
the occurrence of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Prior imaging studies suggest that the amygdala, hippocampal
gyrus, prefrontal cortex, and high-order visual areas are
all brain regions involved in PTSD. However, it is not clear
if those regions mediate the individual a priori vulnerability
to stress or the post trauma abnormal processing of
stress related content. The present study aimed to prospectively
evaluate the individual brain reactivity to stress-related
content in relation to a priori personality trait of neuroticism.
For that we studied healthy subjects at two time points
(before and after) a significant stressful life event which is
mandatory recruitment to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF)
serving as combat paramedics. We hypotheses that the brain
reactivity/sensitivity to visual content related to recently
experienced stressful life events will correspond to the level
of neuroticism. We report here on the results of the first
time point from 50 soldiers (25F, age 18&#x02013;20). Soldiers were
scanned (3T. GE) while watching two relevant contents and
two neutral contents: military, medical, neutral, and scrambled,
respectively. In order to evaluate brain reactivity to
those contents we used backward masked images presented
at 33 ms or 83 ms. We found overall greater activation for
high than low neurotics in the amygdala, enthorhinal cortex,
and orbitofrontal cortex. These initial results suggest that
certain brain areas in high neurotics are hyperactive during
stress related visual detection task. Interestingly, those regions
have been indicated before as mediating the expression
of core personality traits.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e354" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CODING 3D BY 3V</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ahissar</surname><given-names>E. </given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovat 76100, Israel</aff></front-stub><body><p>Rats use their whiskers (vibrissae) to localize and identify objects
in their vicinity. We recently revealed the neural codes
used by vibrissal receptors to encode the coordinates of object
location in three dimensions. We found that the most
efficient neural code for each of the three spatial dimensions
is different: temporal for the horizontal axis (along whisker
rows), spatial for the vertical (along whisker arcs), and rate
for the radial axis (from the face out). What is the advantage
of such triple coding scheme? In theory, suchmultiplexing of
sensory information increases channel efficiency as less neurons
and less axons are required; the same neurons can convey
information on three dimensions at the same time without
losing accuracy or reliability. By the fact that it fires, a
neuron conveys information about the vertical coordinate of
the object. The time of its firing, in relation to other &#x0201c;reference&#x0201d;
neuronal signals, conveys information about the horizontal
coordinate, and the number of spikes it generates during
one whisking cycle conveys information about the radial
coordinate. The output signal of this neuron can be conveyed
in parallel to different readout circuits, each decoding one
specific variable. In practice, however, the rat probably does
not limit itself to one such framework. Our behavioral data
indicate that (a) rats have enormous motor flexibility in controlling
whisker movements, and (b) rats continuously adapt
their motor strategies. How rats exploit motor flexibility and
efficient coding to achieve their goals is a serious challenge
for future research.</p><p>

<italic>Background</italic>. Antipsychotics used in schizophrenia are
dopamine-D2-receptor (DA2R) antagonists. Dopamine activation
of DA2R causes downregulation of protein kinase A (PKA) activity and cAMP production. Prostate apoptosis
response 4 (Par-4) mediates dopamine-induced PKA inhibition.
Prolonged DA2R activation leads to G-protein-coupled
receptor desensitization involving two protein families&#x02014;
GRKs and beta-arrestins. Beta-arrestins bind to phosphorylated
receptors preventing further G protein stimulation
and downstream signaling. The AKT1-GSK-3beta pathway
has also been implicated in schizophrenia [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. <italic>Objective
and methods</italic>. To examine whether Par-4, beta-arrestin1,
AKT1 and GSK-3beta are involved in the pathophysiology
of schizophrenia, protein levels of Par-4 and beta-arrestin1
were measured in lymphocyte-derived cell-lines and AKT1
and Ser-9-phospho-GSK-3beta- in postmortem frontal cortex
from schizophrenia patients versus healthy controls. <italic>Results</italic>.
beta-arrestin1 levels were &#x0223c;2 fold increased and Par-
4&#x02014;unaltered in schizophrenia. Ser-9-phospho-GSK-3beta
levels were &#x0223c;50% decreased but, in contrast with Emamian
et al [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], no difference in AKT1 levels was found. Conclusions.
DA2R hyperactivation hypothesized to occur in schizophrenia
may lead to a compensatory beta-arrestin1 upregulation
and decreased in the GSK-3beta's inactive form (phosphorylated
on Ser-9) due to PKA inactivation. Beta-arrestins
are also signal transducers on their own [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. As such, elevated
beta-arrestin1 would result in elevated, rather than
decreased, Ser-9-phospho-GSK-3beta, suggesting that betaarrestin1
is not a signal transducer of the PI3K-AKT1-GSK-
3beta cascade in the frontal cortex.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">

brain areas is known to be dramatically affected by
environMental factors, in particular by neonatal experiences
and learning events. Since astrocytes play an important
role in neuronal plasticity during brain development,
we investigated whether they respond to environMental
stimulation, which would indicate their possible involvement
in experience-induced synaptic plasticity. To test this hypothesis,
the impact of adverse juvenile emotional experience
(6 hours of isolation stress) on glial plasticity was assessed
in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and in the somatosensory
cortex (SSC) of 19-day-old trumpet-tailed rats
(Octodon degus) 1 hour (short interval = SI) or 48 hours
(long interval = LI) after stress exposure. Densities of S100&#x000df;immunoreactive
astrocytes in each cortical layer were quantitatively
compared between the two isolation groups and a
nonstressed control group. In comparison to controls, SI as
well as LI pups displayed significantly increased densities of
S100&#x000df;-immunoreactive astrocytes in layer II-III and layer VVI
but not in layer I, whereas only the SI pups showed significantly
reduced densities of GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytes
in the mPFC. Isolation stress had no effect on S100&#x000df;and
GFAP-immunoreactivity in the somatosensory cortex.
Furthermore, we observed higher numbers of astrocytic processes
and astrocytic nodes in the mPFC of LI animals in
comparison to controls, soma size of astrocytes did not differ
between groups. Our results confirm our hypothesis that
in the juvenile brain astrocytes respond to emotional stimulation
in a region-, time-, and layer-specific manner. These
alterations in astroglial reaction may have consequences in
neuron-glia interactions and thereby affect the involvement
of astrocytes in modulating synaptic activity.</p><p>

levels are low during the follicular phase, postpartum,
and perimenopausal periods; whereas a remission in
symptoms is observed when estrogen levels are high during
the lutheal phase and pregnancy. Based on this line
of findings, the estrogen hypothesis of schizophrenia postulated
that estrogen has a neuroprotective effect delaying
the onset of schizophrenia and reducing severity of symptoms
in women. Latent inhibition (LI), the poorer conditioning
to a stimulus that received nonreinforced preexposure
prior to conditioning, is disrupted in rats and humans
treated with the psychosis inducing drug amphetamine and
in acute schizophrenia patients. Hence, we investigated the
LI phenomenon and its modulation by gonadal hormones
in cyclic and ovariectomized female rats. LI was measured
in a thirst motivated conditioned emotional response procedure.
Our results demonstrate that (1) females showed LI
only if preexposure took place during estrus and conditioning
took place during metestrus (estrus-metestrus), but not
during the remaining sequential phases of the estrous cycle;
(2) both haloperidol and clozapine restored LI in proestrousestrous
rats but failed to restore LI in diestrous-proestrous
rats, while LI in the metestrous-diestrous group was restored
only by clozapine; (3) LI was disrupted in ovariectomized
rats and restored only by clozapine. These results suggest that
the expression of LI and its sensitivity to neuroleptics in female
rats is correlated with hormonal fluctuation. Moreover, resistance of disrupted LI to haloperidol contrasts with its
efficacy to restore amphetamine-induced LI disruption, suggesting
that hormonal-induced LI disruption might reflect
different underlying mechanisms. Considering the link between
estrogen and psychotic outbreaks, clarifying the role
of gonadal hormones in LI, may shed light on their role in
schizophrenia as well as on gender differences in this psychopathology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e602" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>AGE- AND GENDER-DEPENDENT COGNITIVE DEFICITS

and tau hyper-phosphorylation on cognitive decline in
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is still poorly understood. We
have evaluated cortical, amygdala (AMY) and hippocampal
(HIP) behavioral activity in a triple transgenic mouse
(3xTg) model which consists of three mutant human genes
(APPKM670/671NL, PS1M146V, and tauP301L) that develop
A-b and tau pathologies in an age-dependent manner.
Mice at three different ages (2, 10, and 16 months old)
were assessed in a battery of behavioral tests: object recognition
(OR), Morris water maze (MWM), and Pavlovian fear
conditioning (PFC). Spatial reference memory was not affected
by transgenic status, age (up to 16 months) or gender,
but impairments related to age and gender were found
in the retention test and in the reversal learning test, which
may indicate dorso-HIP and putative frontal cortex dysfunction.
Similar results were found in the object recognition
test, a test that exploits the rodent's spontaneous preference
for novel objects and strongly relies on visual memory, indicating
also possible deficits in HIP and non-HIP structures
like the perirhinal cortex. All 3xTg mice responded similarly
when tested for PFC, indicating no detectable deficits or abnormalities
in the brain areas that are responsible for such
behavior. This includes the ventral hippocampus in the context
test and the AMY in the tone test. Histological analysis
of brain sections revealed a significant number of plaques in
Hippocampus, cortex, as well as AMY and subiculum. We
conclude that the impairments in cognitive flexibility and
OR in older 3xTG mice are indicative of HIP, frontal and
entorhinal cortex dysfunction and may be correlated with
the appearance of A-b plaques and Tau phosphorylation in
these brain areas. However, the presence of A-b plaques and
phosphorylated Tau in the AMY and subiculum was not
correlated with the PFC test results presented here.</p><p>

sensorimotor associations is the interference paradigm
(Krakauer et al, 1999; Boch et al, 2001; Shadmehr and
Brashers-Krug, 1997). In this learning scheme, disruption in
the stabilization of the motor memory trace, termed interference,
may be retrograde, where the second task disrupts
the retention of the newly acquired first task, or anterograde
when the second task impairs performance of the first task on
retest (Robertson et al, 2004). We sought to investigate the
mutual interactions between visuomotor rotation and viscous
force field to which subjects adapted in sequence. We
previously showed results of facilitation and interference in
the initial directional planning of reach movements (Arce
et al, ISFN Abstract, 2005). Here we show the interactions
involving late trajectory correction. Like the results found
in direction planning, we found mutual facilitation in the
direction-matched perturbations requiring matched motor
adjustments. In contrast, opposite perturbations requiring
opposing adjustments interfered. The presence of facilitation
or interference suggests that the newly-acquired internal
representations of kinematic and dynamic perturbations are
not independent but they share common neuronal resources.
Such overlap does not necessarily imply competition of resources.</p><p>

driven by the potential use of these cells for cellular
therapy of neurodegenerative disorders, stroke, trauma,

and characterize a population of neuronal progenitors in
the human umbilical cord blood (HUCB) mononuclear cell
(MNC) fraction, for in vitro manipulation towards neuronal differentiation. Selection of the HUCB neuronal progenitors
(HUCBNPs) was based on the neuronal prerequisite
of adherence to collagen. Populations of collagen-adherent,
nestin-positive (94.8 &#x000b1; 2.9%) progenitors expressing alpha
1/2 integrin receptors, as revealed byWestern blot and adhesion
assay using selective antagonists, were isolated and survived
for more than 14 days. In vitro differentiation of the
HUCBNPs was achieved by treatment with neuronal conditioning
media (CM) supplemented with 10 ng/mL nerve
growth factor (NGF). Some 83 &#x000b1; 8.2% of the surviving progenitors
acquired a neuronal-like morphology, expressed by
cellular outgrowths of different lengths. About 35 &#x000b1; 6% of
the HUCBNPs had long outgrowths with a length/cell diameter
ratio greater than 2, typical of developing neurons.
The majority of these progenitors, analyzed by immunocytochemistry
and/or RT-PCR, expressed common neuronal
markers such as microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP-2; 98.5 &#x000b1; 2%), neurotrophin receptor (TrkA; 98.5 &#x000b1; 0.06%),
neurofillament-160 (NF-160; 94.2 &#x000b1; 1%), beta-tubulin III
(89.8 &#x000b1; 4.2%) and neuron specific enolase (NSE). Combined
CM and NGF treatment induced constitutive activation
of the mitogen-activated protein kinases ERK2, p38alpha
and p38beta (36, 9, and 23-fold, resp, versus the control),
most likely related to survival and/or differentiation. The results
point to operationally defined conditions for activating
HUCBNPs neuronal differentiation ex vivo and emphasize
the crucial role of neuronal CM and NGF in this process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e823" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MRI CHARACTERIZATION OF CNS NBS-1 KNOCKOUT MICE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Assaf</surname><given-names>Y. </given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="a18">

recessive disorder caused by a mutation in the gene NBS-1.
NBS-1 produces nibrin, a protein believed to play a significant
role in DNA damage response. NBS patients suffer from
many of the symptoms of Ataxia-telangiectasia (variant
V1) subjects including immunodeficiency, chromosomal
instability, and lymphoreticular malignancies. The disorder
itself causes brain microcephaly, that leads to severe developmental
disorders and that frequently lead to pre-mature
death of the subjects. In this work we have conducted an
MRI study on conditional CNS Nbs1-del and wild-type
(WT) mice in order to characterize, for the first time, the in
vivo appearance and integrity of various brain structures in
NBS. T2 weighted MRI revealed significant morphological
and contrast changes between the CNS Nbs1-del and WT
groups. First, the brains of the CNS Nbs1-del mice were
significantly smaller than those of the WT with emphasized
mal-development of the cerebellum. In addition, the typical
hypo-intense white matter signal in the corpus callosum,
internal-capsule, and cerebellar folia disappeared. Region
of interest analysis revealed that white matter areas of CNS
Nbs1-del mice have significantly higher T2 values than
those of WT mice. The white matter areas that were studied
were the corpus callosum, the cerebellar folia, internal
capsule, and optic nerve. In contrast, any of the studied
gray matter areas did not show differences between the
two groups except for the hippocampus in which the T2 of
the CNS Nbs1-del group was higher than the WT group.
Higher T2 values in the white matter and hippocampus
might indicate a progressive degenerative process occurring
in these regions. These results suggest that white matter
damage plays a significant role if not the leading role in the
degeneration of CNS Nbs1-del mice brains. The observed
damage might imply that damage to the oligodendrocytes is
more severe than other types of cells in NBS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e895" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NOVEL STRATEGY TERMED &#x0201c;REDOX CLUSTER BOMB&#x0201d;

Lower GSH levels correlated with the activation of mitogenactivated
proteins kinases (MAPK) have been demonstrated
in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and other neurodegenerative
disorders and have been proposed to play a
central role in the deterioration of the aging and neurodegenerative
brain. As a potential use for neurodegeneration we
have developed a novel strategy termed the &#x0201c;Redox Cluster
Bomb.&#x0201d; It consists of a matrix of low molecular weight and
nontoxic thiol compounds that are also inhibitors of MAPKs,
p38, and ERK1/2. Upon penetration into the cell through
the plasma membrane, the molecule is cleaved by the intracellular
enzymatic machinery to generate a large number of
smaller molecules, each one has the power to scavenge free
radicals, generate GSH, and protect the cell from oxidation.
This property gives an amplified action as well as a prolongation
of the redox effects. Our results are consistent with
the notion that the &#x0201c;cluster bomb&#x0201d; strategy may play an efficient
protective role against neurotoxicity and thus would be
suited for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e912" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GATING AND ASSEMBLY MODALITIES OF A HUMAN

of voltage-gated K+ channels. The KCNQ1 pore-forming alpha subunit interacts with the KCNE1 auxiliary subunits
to form the slow IKS K+ current which plays a major
role in repolarizing the cardiac action potential. Mutations
in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes produce the long QT
(LQT) syndrome, a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia.
We will discuss the biophysical and structural properties of
two important gating modules, the pore and the C-terminus
of KCNQ1. Removal of external Ca2+ produces a striking
voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation in WT KCNQ1
channels. Adding external Ca2+ suppresses the macroscopic
inactivation with an EC50 of 1.5 micromolar. Mutagenesis
studies and structural modeling indicate that external Ca2+
ions are tightly coordinated by two glutamate residues located
at the outer pore in the turret region. Thus, external
Ca2+ exquisitely controls KCNQ1 channel gating by preventing
relaxation into slow macroscopic inactivation. We identified
a similar slow inactivation in a KCNQ1 LQT pore mutant
which hinders entry of external Ba2+ to its deep site
in the pore and traps it by slowing its egress. Kinetic studies,
structural modeling and dynamics simulations suggest
that this slow inactivation involves conformational changes
that converge to the selectivity filter and constrict the outer
carbonyl ring of site s1, where the backbone becomes less
flexible. This mechanism considerably differs from C-type
inactivation where vacation of K+ from the filter was invoked.
We suggest that trapping of K+ at s1 and consequent
hindrance of the dehydration-resolvation transition underlie
the slow inactivation mechanism of KCNQ1 channels. Biophysical
and structural analysis of the KCNQ1 C-terminus
and LQT mutants indicates that in healthy individuals, CaM
binding to KCNQ1 is essential for correct channel folding,
assembly, and gating.</p><p>

such, the patterns of action potentials in these cells are central
to cerebellar function. Bi-stability of Purkinje cell membrane
potential has been demonstrated both in vitro and in
vivo. Currently there is an ongoing debate regarding the existence
of Purkinje cell bi-stability in awake animals. Serotonin
(5-HT) has been shown to emphasize bi-stability in
slice preparation (Williams et al, 2002), and is known to be
elevated in the cerebellum of awake animals during alertness
and around significant events (Schonewille et al, 2006). To
investigate the role of 5-HT in controlling bi-stability in intact
animals, we performed extracellular recordings of Purkinje
cell activity in anesthetized guinea pigs using sharp glass
pipettes, and locally applied 5-HT using a custom-built injection
pipette whose tip was 100&#x02013;300 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>m away from the

layer of the cerebellar cortex and identified by complex
spikes existence. We compared the spontaneous activity

We analyzed the modulation in simple spikes activity
focusing on the statistics of the inter-spike-intervals of the
simple spikes and their instantaneous firing rate. We found
that 5-HT significantly modulated the firing patterns of cerebellar
Purkinje cells. Two significant modulations were observed:
(1) tonically firing Purkinje cells exhibit bi-stability
after 5-HT application. Since there was a clear tendency toward
longer quiescent period, we propose that 5-HT accentuated
the bi-modal behavior of Purkinje cell. (2) The
firing of the Purkinje cells becomes more regular, and the
distribution of the higher firing frequencies is shifted towards
lower values and fewer instances of low frequencies are
apparent.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e989" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DOPAMINE NEURON DEGENERATION IN C. ELEGANS:

the origin of the pathogenesis and the molecular determinants

to the PD-associated neurotoxin 6-OHDA and Mn, and
cell death likely occurs through a novel pathway. We also
show that a number of PD-associated genes contribute to
the cell death. We have now instituted genetic and chemical
screens for regulators of toxin-mediated cell death, and we

disorder of unknown origin for which no effective drug
treatment is currently available. It occurs in women in adolescence
and is characterized by severe low weight, cognitive
distortions about body shape and weight and amenorrhea.
It begins with &#x0201c;harmless&#x0201d; attempts at dieting which gets
out of control. The patients think themselves to be too fat
even when severely underweight. Understanding the interaction
between severe reduction of body weight and cognitive
function may lead to new strategies for the treatment of AN.
Three kinds of animal models have been developed: diet restriction
(DR), activity wheel, and separation stress, each of
which mimics some aspects of the human disease. DR may
benefit or impair animal cognition or motor performance
depending on the degree of restriction. DR to 60% improved
maze performance whereas 40% DR impaired it and was
associated with high mortality. We have studied the effects
of tyrosine as a catecholamine precursor, and endocannabinoids,
derived from essential fatty acids, as neuromodulators.
We have found that severe DR impaired the adrenergic,
cholinergic, serotonergic, and opiate systems while tyrosine
almost reversed the effects. Tyrosine or EC supplementation
to the 40% DR mice improved cognitive function and brain
neurotransmitters without increasing body weight. Such a
strategy might break the vicious cycle in initiating treatment
in patients with AN. Patients sometimes will not respond to
supportive and psychological treatment before there is nutritional
rehabilitation. Following these results we are currently
undertaking clinical trials of THC and tyrosine in the treatment
of AN. Treatment with tyrosine or THC caused improved
cognitive function, treatment with THC caused differences
in food consumption with regard to flexibility of
food eaten. Both tyrosine and THC could be used as therapeutic
agents for AN.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1220" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DYSREGULATED BDNF SECRETION FROM MONOCYTES

the effect of IFN-beta therapy on this regulation. <italic>Methods</italic>.
PBMCs of 12 healthy controls (HC), 12 untreated (UMS),
and 12 INF-beta treated (IMS) RR-MS patients were incubated
in the absence or presence of a CD40-activation agonist:
anti-CD40 mAb (10 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/mL). After 24 hours of incubation,
the cell supernatants BDNF level was detected by
ELISA. HC, UMS, and IMS cells were compared for the
secreted BDNF levels obtained in the absence of stimulus
(basal secretion) and for the individual ratio between
CD40 activation and basal secretion level (BDNF secretion
response to CD40 activation). CD40 expression on CD14+
momocytes was studied by flow cytometry.<italic>Results</italic>. The
basal BDNF secretion from PBMCs of HC or IMS was
found to be high as compared to that of UMS patients (HC
1020.67 &#x000b1; 304.74 pg/mL, IMS 1336.20 &#x000b1; 454.73, and UMS
675.04 &#x000b1; 198.32, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). The PBMCs of UMS patients were found to be significantly less responsive to CD40 activation
compared to that of HC or IMS (HC basal/CD40 ratio 1.32 &#x000b1; 0.24, IMS ratio 1.53 &#x000b1; 0.31, and UMS ratio
1.08 &#x000b1; 0.12, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .007). No such effect was shown when
matched isotype control or anti-CD3 mAb was added. The
surface expression of this CD40 on CD14+ monocytes of
HC was significantly enhanced during incubation as compared
to UMS (HC %CD14+/CD40+ 1.66 &#x000b1; 0.55, UMS
0.75 &#x000b1; 0.1, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). Furthermore, in vitro addition of INFbeta
(10 ng/mL) to this UMS cells upregulated their CD40
expression (2.31 &#x000b1; 0.34) and enhanced BDNF secretion response
to CD40 activation.<italic>Conclusions</italic>. Our results show
dysregulated BDNF secretion fromMSmonocytes via CD40.
We also suggest an additional neuroprotective immunomodulatory
effect for INF-beta as it showed to this revised
dysregulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1268" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>AGE DIFFERENCES IN BRAIN ACTIVATION DURING

many studies could not demonstrate decline in naming
performance and thus the cognitive and neural source of
this problem remains controversial. We constructed a naming
test in which common objects pictured from usual viewpoint
were presented. Recently we reported that the behavioral
naming performance of old participants was similar to
young ones (Gigi et al [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). In the current research, we applied
fMRI to study brain activation patterns of young and
old participants during naming performance. Seven young
adults (mean age 26.2 &#x000b1; 2.3) and eight older adults (61 &#x000b1; 14.8)
participated in the study. We found brain activations differences
between the two age groups. The prominent difference
included the right inferior prefrontal cortex (BA47) that appeared
to be significantly activated in young participants but
not in older participants. Hippocampus and medial-lateral
prefrontal cortex (BA9, BA46) activations were found prominently
in the older group. Taking into account the lack of age
differences in the behavioral performance, and the known
loss of frontal cortex volume with age (eg, Raz et al [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]), we
suggest that the variation in brain activity between the two
age groups relates to brain compensation and alternative networks
that enable the successful naming performance of old

mainly caused due to loss resulting in the depletion of
dopamine producing neurons in the substantia nigra. Pharmacological
treatments aimed to increase the deficient
dopaminergic neurotransmission being effective in ameliorating
the symptoms of the disease, but none of these therapies
are curative. It was suggested that treatment with neurotrophic
factors might either protect the remaining healthy
dopaminergic neurons or prevent death of damaged neurons
and induce proliferation of axonal nerve terminals
of surviving neurons. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic
factor (GDNF) is currently the most effective substance
shown to increase dopaminergic neuronal survival in culture
and promote its survival and axonal growth in animal
models of PD. We therefore aimed to differentiate human
bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into
astrocyte-like cells, capable of producing neurotrophic factors
(NTFs). Indeed, MSCs treated with our novel astrocyte
differentiation medium present astocyte-like morphology
and express the astrocyte marker, S100&#x000e2;, glutamine
synthetase (GS), and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP).
Moreover, these astrocyte-like cells produce and secrete significant
amounts of GDNF, nerve growth factor (NGF), and
brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as indicated by
mRNA, RT-PCR, ELISA, and Western blot analysis. When
these GDNF-producing cells were transplanted into the
striatum of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) lesioned rats,
a model of PD, they produced a progressive reduction in
the rotational behavior induced by apomorphine administration
as well as improvement in rotor-rod and the unflower-
eating tests. Histological assessments revealed that the
cells survived and expressed astrocyte and human markers.
Our results indicate that GDNF-producing cells derived
from human bone marrow stem cells might be used
as a new strategy for autologous restorative transplantation
in PD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1474" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INTERFERENCE TO CONSOLIDATION PHASE GAINS IN

<italic>Background</italic>. There are two expressions of procedural memory
consolidation: (a) delayed performance gains evolving
hours after training, and (b) a decrease in the susceptibility
of the training-related gains to interference by subsequent experience.
We showed previously (ISFN 2005) that the handwriting
of words in a well-practiced script immediately after
training on the finger opposition sequence (FOS) task interfered
with the expected delayed gains. Here we compared
the interference, on FOS learning in the left hand and in the
righthand, exerted by handwriting using the right hand. We
also tested whether the level of experience in the FOS and in
the handwriting affected the degree of interference. <italic>Method</italic>.
Right handed participants (<italic>n</italic> = 33) underwent a baseline
(no interference) and an interference training condition, one
week apart. The two study phases were identical except that
in the interference phase, participants were given the interference
task (handwriting, dominant hand, 16 repetitions of
two words) immediately after FOS training. <italic>Exp 1:</italic> participants
trained the FOS with either the right or the left hand.
Interference consisted of common Hebrew words. <italic>Exp 2:</italic> the
participants trained the FOS with their right hand. Interference
consisted of common Hebrew words or nonwords written
in Hebrew letters.<italic>Results</italic>. <italic>Exp 1:</italic> interference occurred
only when practice in the FOS and the subsequent handwriting
were performed by the same hand. <italic>Exp 2:</italic> unlike writing
common words, there was no interference by handwriting of
non-words, although both tasks were executed with the same
hand. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Interference occurs when there is a critical
neuronal overlap between the representations of two tasks.
The extent of overlap between the representations is related,
at least in part, to (a) lateralization, that is, the execution of
the two tasks with the same/different effector, and (b) the degree
of training in both tasks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1569" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE DEVELOPMENT OF SENSITIVITY TO DYNAMIC

modulation (AM) and frequency modulation (FM) is
important for normal speech perception and language skills.
However, relatively little is known about the normal development
of AM and FMsensitivity in school-age children and
adolescents. In the current experiment we evaluated the developmental
time course of sensitivity to sinusoidal AM(carrier:
1 s white-noise; modulation rates: 8, 64, and 125 Hz)
and FM (carrier: 1.5 s 1-kHz; modulation rates: 2, 20, and
240 Hz) across children aged 8&#x02013;10 and 11&#x02013;12-year/old and
adults. For FM, both average performance (mean) and performance
consistency (within-listener standard deviation)
were adult like in the 8&#x02013;10-year/old for all three rates. On the
other hand, for AM, average performance was still not adultlike
in the 10&#x02013;12-year/old for any rate. Poorer AM sensitivity
in children could not, however, be attributed to poorer
performance consistency in this group since standard deviation
stayed stable across the three age groups. The different
developmental time courses of average sensitivity and performance
consistency for AM suggest that these two measures
of performance may be governed by separate mechanisms.
Furthermore, the presence of developmental improvement
in AM but not FM sensitivity suggests that, contrary
to theories based on data obtained from adults, at least
during development, sensitivity to AM and FM may be limited
by different neuronal bottlenecks thatmature at different
rates.</p><p>

Cox2 expression after 24 hours. Sertraline and paroxetine
induced an increase in caspase 3 specific activity. Flow cytometric
analysis of propidium iodide stained rat splenocytes
showed that sertraline and paroxetine induced a G1/G0

the antidepressants induced a dose-dependent increase

was explored using a model of layer 5 pyramidal neuron.
In this model, synaptic plasticity in the apical tree is
dominated by local dendritic Ca spikes via Hebbian spiketiming-
dependent plasticity (STDP), whereas plasticity of
peri-somatic and basal synapses is dominated by an identical
Hebbian STDP rule with axo-somatic Na spikes. The
somatic and the dendritic &#x0201c;synaptic teachers&#x0201d; interact with
each other via back-propagating action potentials (BPAPs)
from the soma to the dendrites that facilitate the generation
of dendritic Ca spikes (BAC firing). In turn, the BAC
firing encourages generation of Na spike bursts at the axosomatic
region. We show that there exists a wide range of
synaptic, excitability, and input parameters whereby the percentage
of strong and weak synapses over the whole dendritic
tree is rather equal. In other parameter regimes, either deneritic
synapses survive and proximal synapses die-out, or vice
versa. We conclude that several local dendritic &#x0201c;teachers&#x0201d; for
synaptic plasticity may peacefully coexist in the same neuron,
thus enabling a fine local control of synaptic efficacy using a

state and attentional deficits (&#x0201c;antimuscarinic psychosis&#x0201d;)
along with findings of cholinergic abnormalities in
schizophrenia have led to a growing interest in the involvement
of the cholinergic system in this disorder. Latent inhibition
(LI) is a cross-species phenomenon manifested as a
poorer conditioning of a stimulus seen when the stage of conditioning
is preceded by a stage of repeated nonreinforced
preexposure to that stimulus, and is considered to index
the capacity to in-attend irrelevant stimuli. Amphetamineinduced
LI disruption and its reversal by antipsychotic drugs
(APDs) is a well-established model of positive symptoms of
schizophrenia. Here we tested whether the muscarinic antagonist
scopolamine would disrupt LI and whether such
disruption would be reversed by APDs and by the acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor physostigmine. The results showed that scopolamine at doses of 0.15 and 0.5 mg/kg disrupted
LI, and that this effect was due to the action of the drug
in the preexposure stage, suggesting a role of muscarinic
transmission in attentional processes underlying LI. Both
the typical and the atypical APDs, haloperidol and clozapine,
reversed scopolamine-induced LI disruption when given
in conditioning or in both stages, but not in preexposure,
indicating that the mechanism of antipsychotic action in
this model is independent of the mechanism of action of
the propsychotic drug. Scopolamine-induced LI disruption
was reversed by physostigmine (0.05 and 0.15 mg/kg) which
was ineffective in reversing amphetamine-induced LI disruption.
This points to distinct mechanisms underlying LI disruption
by scopolamine and amphetamine, and by corollary,
scopolamine- and amphetamine-induced psychoses. We
propose scopolamine-induced LI disruption as a model of
cholinergic-related positive symptoms in schizophrenia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1791" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PERSISTENT ACTIVITY IN NETWORKS WITH

anti-pY, and the resulting immune-complexes were probed
for levels of NR2B, NR2A, NR1, and for additional proteins
in the pY complex. Exposure of animals to saccharin significantly
increased the phosphorylation of the fyn kinase target
Y-1472 on NR2B. The precipitated pY complex also showed
an elevation in levels of NR2A, NR2B, NR1, and in PSD 95.
To test whether these changes are localized to the synapse,
we analyzed the synatosomal fractions of the insular cortex
from water and saccharin treated rats. Surprisingly, one hour
after exposure to the novel taste, there was a dramatic decrease
in the levels of NR2A, NR2B, and NR1 in the synaptic
area. These changes were accompanied by a similar reduction
in the levels of AMPA GluR1 subunit, suggesting weakening
of synaptic strength. Finally, a bilateral, local infusion
of the general tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein to the insular
cortex of rats exposed to saccharin caused a significant
decrease in the levels of tyrosine phosphorylated NR2B. In
accordance, a single microinjection of genistein to the insular
cortex immediately prior to the preexposure period in
the latent inhibition paradigm significantly attenuated taste
memory. Together our data indicate a specific requirement
for tyrosine phosphorylation in the insular cortex during the
acquisition of novel taste.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1843" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NANOSCALE GEOGRAPHY OF SNARE COMPLEXES

the SNARE complex, which is crucial for vesicle fusion.
Syntaxin-1A is concentrated in cholesterol-rich clusters at
the plasma membrane (PM) that might function as docking
and fusion sites for exocytosis. The formation of the nonproductive
cis-SNARE complexes between PM-SNAREs counteracts
the formation of trans-SNARE complexes between
the PM syntaxin, SNAP-25, and vesicular SNARE, synaptobrevin.
The formation of SNARE complexes depends on
the local SNARE-availability, which might be determined by
the cluster dynamics and the disassembly of cis-complexes
by NSF and &#x000e1;-SNAP. The goal of this research is to examine
the SNARE nonhomogenous distribution and kinetics
on the PM at the nonoscale resolution in various advanced molecular, microscopical, and computational methods. Assembly
and disassembly of PM SNARE cis complexes were
investigated, using the PM sheets preparation. The rate of
SNARE complexes assembly was found to be only slightly affected
by cholesterol depletion, which should lead to disintegration
of the syntaxin clusters. To learn more about the dynamics
of the SANRE proteins on the PM, we built a Monte
Carlo simulation and examined assembly and disassembly of
cis complexes, with or without syntaxin domains. We developed
a graphic interface that enables to monitor the proteins'
movement and complex formation. Consistent with our experimental
findings, clustering of syntaxin only slightly slows
down the spontaneous formation of cis-SNARE complexes.
The dissociation of the cis complex on the PM sheets by the
NSF/&#x000e1;-SNAP was found to be much faster, exhibiting a linear
dependency on the concentration of NSF and &#x000e1;-SNAP. In
summary, the combination of the cell surface simulation and
the PM sheets experiments allows to examine the influence of
the syntaxin clusters on assembly and disassembly of SNARE
complexes with the final goal to understand the biological
role of the clusters.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1967" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE IMPACT OF NETWORK ACTIVITY ON

investigating the dynamics of single neurons. At the

aspects of neural networks. There still is, however,
a great gap between these two realms. Our research aims
to combine the biological and mathematical methodologies
by analyzing measurements taken from pyramidal neurons
of layer 5 of the somatosensory cortex. These neurons are
known to interact with their surrounding network activity.
This surrounding network activity, though being measured
in vitro, simulates key parameters of actual in vivo activity
(ie, spontaneous flow of synaptic input). This activity is generated
using innovative techniques alongside the use of wellknown
methods (eg, whole-cell patch-clamp). We explore
intrinsic mechanisms of information processing in the form
of synaptic input, and the influence of background activity
on it. Therefore, the focus is on measuring backpropagation
within each neuron in various locations along the apical dendrite
under different levels of network activity. According to
preliminary results the backpropagating action potential has
not been changed due to increased background synaptic activity,
yet, the calcium spike, generated when backpropagating
action potential and distal synaptic input couple, is modulated
by that activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2007" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LENTIVIRAL TRANSDUCTION OF HUMAN BONE

that cause enduring changes in neural plasticity and synaptic
efficacy which appear to play pivotal roles in the pathophysiology
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Brain-derived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF) has been implicated in
the neurobiological mechanisms of these changes, in interaction
with components of the stress-response, such as corticosterone.
This study examined the consequences of juvenile
stress on behavior at later stages of life in correlation
to circulating corticosterone levels, BDNF, and TrkB mRNA expression. The experiments looked at single exposure
to predator scent stress as opposed to repeated exposure,
early in life, and later on. Behavioral responses were
assessed in the elevated plus-maze and the acoustic startle
response paradigms. Animals were subsequently sacrificed,
and brain areas dissected and analyzed for mRNA BDNF
and TrkB levels. The results show that juvenile trauma increases
the vulnerability for developing long-term behavioral
disruptions, taken to represent posttraumatic stress responses,
subsequent to reexposure to the same stressor in
adulthood. Juvenile exposure significantly lowered corticosterone
levels compared to controls, whereas adulthood exposure
caused significant increases. Exposure to both early
and later life trauma elicited reduced levels of corticosterone
following the initial exposure, which were not raised by reexposure
and elicited significant downregulation of mRNA for
BDNF in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, compared
to the other groups. The results suggest that juvenile stress
has resounding effects in adulthood reflected in behavioral
responses. The concomitant changes in BDNF and corticosterone
levels may mediate the changes in neural plasticity
and synaptic functioning underlying clinical manifestations
of PTSD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2168" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE INVOLVEMENT OF CORTICAL mTOR IN

its role in cortical-dependent learning is not clear. In order

Additional biochemical analysis of several downstream targets
of mTOR signaling was performed following similar local
microinjection to the insular cortex. We observed decreased
phosphorylation levels of ribosomal protein kinase
S6K1 (Thr 389) and initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) (Ser 209),
elevated phosphorylation levels of elongation factor 2 (eEF2)
(Thr 56), and a decrease in the total levels of elongation
factor 1A (eEF1A). MAPK/ERK2 phosphorylation was not
affected by inhibition of mTOR signaling, suggesting that
MAPK and mTOR cascades are working in parallel in the
taste cortex. These results suggest that mTOR pathway in the
insular cortex is involved in the process of novel taste memory
formation. Currently, we are further exploring the role
of mTOR in the insular cortex during the formation of longterm

risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), is associated with increased
Abeta deposition. The initial stages of the amyloid
cascade play a pivotal role in AD. The objective of this work
was to investigate the pathological effects of the initial aggregation
stages of Abeta and the effects thereon of apoE4. This
was investigated by studying the effects of the apoE genotype
on Abeta-mediated cellular pathology in apoE transgenic
mice following prolonged inhibition of neprilysin. Under
basal conditions the density of hippocampal neurons of
transgenic mice which express either apoE4 or, the AD benign
allele, apoE3 was similar. In contrast, elevation of brain
Abeta levels by inhibition of neprilysin resulted in a significant
decrease in the density of CA1 neurons of the apoE4
mice (&#x0223c;30%) which reached a plateau at two weeks. Whereas
the CA1 neurons of the apoE3 mice were not affected during
the first 2 weeks and were only partly reduced by 4 weeks
following initiation of the treatment. This effect was specific
to CA1. Furthermore, the CA1 neurons of the apoE4 mice
contained significant levels of activated caspase 3 at 2 weeks
and 4 weeks; whereas this activity was detected at the apoE3
mice only at 4 weeks. Additionalmeasurements of inflammatory
activation revealed progressive microgliosis, which was
markedly more pronounced in the apoE4 than in the apoE3
mice, and similar but low levels of astrogliosis in both mice.
These results show that apoE4 stimulates Abeta-mediated
apoptosis of CA1 neurons in vivo and suggest that this effect
may be mediated via microglia. This effect is apparent
within a week, during which insoluble Abeta is scarce, and
does not colocalize with the insoluble Abeta deposits. This
suggests that the proapoptotic effects of apoE4 are mediated
by soluble Abeta oligomers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2217" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>G-PROTEIN-COUPLED RECEPTORS ARE VOLTAGE

most signal transduction processes. Binding of agonist is considered the only mechanism for activation of a GPCR.
Yet, in a number of experimental systems, changes in membrane
potential affected the agonist efficacy in activating
the GPCR. In all these cases the process and protein which
is voltage sensitive had not been identified. Even though
GPCRs span the cell membrane they are not considered to
be voltage sensitive. Recently it was found in our laboratory
that the affinity for the agonist of two muscarinic GPCRs
is affected by membrane potential. It was unclear, however,
whether the GPCRs themselves are voltage sensitive.
We now show that the m2 and m1 muscarinic receptors display
charge movement, similar to gating currents of voltagegated
channels. The &#x0201c;gating current&#x0201d;-voltage relationship of
the m2R correlates well with the change in affinity of the receptor
for acetylcholine. The 3rd intracellular loop of m2R

been implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease
(PD) at both the genetic and cytopathological levels. aS,
a highly conserved presynaptic protein is a major component
of Lewy bodies&#x02014;interneuronal inclusions that are the
pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease. Despite extensive
study, little is known about the normal function or
pathobiology of aS. Previously we reported that aS interacts
with polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) as part of its
physiological function. We have also shown that aS increases
membrane fluidity by enrichment of membranes specifically
with PUFA. Our working hypothesis is that aS affects membrane
trafficking through its effect on membrane fluidity.
Using incorporation of FM 1&#x02013;43 dye by living MES neurons,
we detect enhanced accumulation of newly formed endosomes
by either supplementing the conditioned medium
with certain PUFAs or by overexpressing aS in the presence
of standard medium. A synergistic enhancement of membrane
trafficking is observed when PUFA treatment is combined
with aS overexpression. The longer and more unsaturated
the FA is, the more potent the enhancement of
membrane trafficking is. Moreover, the PD-causing A53T
mutant form of aS has a stronger effect on membrane trafficking
than wt aS. We now identified an endocytic mechanism
that is activated by aS-mediated enrichment of membranes
with PUFA. aS and PUFA synergistically induced
transferrin endocytosis. Transferrin endocytosis by its receptor
is known to be mediated by receptor-mediated endocytosis
(RME). This result indicates that clathrin-mediated
endocytosis (CME) and (RME) are both induced by PUFAs
and aS. To further verify this observation we used a
dominant negative form of dynamin (K44A) and a shRNA
against clathrin heavy chain. We conclude that aS activates
endocytosis through its effect on membrane PUFA
composition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2373" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LYSOPHOSPHOLIPIDS MODULATE L-TYPE

of a hydrophilic head and a hydrophobic tail. It was
suggested that partition of these molecules into the phospholipid
bilayer alters membrane tension and thereby affects
the gating of mechanosensitive ion channels. LPLs were
defined by their shapes as cones, inverted-cones, or cylinders.
It was suggested that partitioning of inverted-cones into
the outer leaflet of the phospholipid bilayer forms convex
membrane structures mimicking membrane compressionor
cell shrinkage. In this study we examined whether
an inverted-cone-shaped molecule, Lysophosphatidylchloline
(LPC), modulates L-type, and T-type calcium channel
currents (IL and IT) in pituitary cells. Our main findings
may be summarized as follows. (1) LPC (3&#x02013;30 micromolar)
suppressed both IL and IT in a dose-dependent manner.
(2) This suppression of IL and IT was irreversible. Full reversibility
was observed only after washout of LPC with BSA
(0.5mg/ml). (3) The effects of LPC on IL and IT were differential.
The suppression of IT was more prominent than
the suppression of IL. In addition, the suppression of IT
started after a short delay of several seconds whereas the
suppression of IL started after a long delay of 50&#x02013;100 seconds.
(4) The suppression of IL was voltage dependent with
a stronger suppression at more negative potentials. (5) The
negatively charged inverted-cone-shaped lysophosphatidylinositol
(LPI), but not the cylinder-shaped phosphatidylcholine
(PC), had similar effects as those produced by LPC
on calcium currents. In summary, our results show that
lipophilic molecules in the shape of inverted cones suppress
calcium currents in pituitary cells. It is possible that partition
of these molecules into the plasma membrane alters membrane
curvature and tension, thereby modulating calcium influx
in pituitary cells.</p><p>

differences in sexual behavior are heritable, little is
known about the specific molecular genetic design of human
sexuality. Recently, a specific dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4)
agonist was shown in rats to induce penile erection through a
central mechanism. These findings prompted us to examine
possible association between the well-characterized DRD4
gene and core phenotypes of human sexual behavior that included
desire, arousal, and function in a group of 148 nonclinical
university students. Association between five DRD4
polymorphisms (3 promoter SNPs, a 120 bp promoter region
tandem duplication, and the exon3 repeat region) and
self-report questions regarding desire, arousal, and function
were tested using robust family-based methods, FBAT, and
UNPHASED. The DRD4 exon3most common D4.4 repeat is
negatively associated with desire and function scores. Carriers
of the D4.4 repeat display less desire (<italic>Z</italic> = &#x02212;2.02, <italic>P</italic> = .04)
and report more sexual dysfunction (<italic>Z</italic> = &#x02212;2.02, <italic>P</italic> = .04).
The single most frequent (18%) five locus haplotype of the
five DRD4 polymorphisms (C-521T&#x00026;C-616G &#x00026; A-809G &#x00026;
EXON3 &#x00026; 120 bp tandem duplication) genotyped was CG-
G-4-2 and was negatively associated with desire (<italic>Z</italic> = &#x02212;3.19, <italic>P</italic> = .001), arousal (<italic>Z</italic> = &#x02212;2.95, <italic>P</italic> = .003), and
function (<italic>Z</italic> = &#x02212;3.19, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). The current results are
consistent with animal studies that show a role for dopamine
and specifically the DRD4 receptor in sexual behavior and
suggest that one pathway by which individual variation in
human desire, arousal, and function is mediated is based on
allelic variants coding for differences in DRD4 receptor gene
expression and protein concentrations in key brain areas.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2581" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>OBJECT RECOGNITION MODEL INSPIRED

recognition algorithms in recent years, these algorithms still
do not compare with the human ability for object recognition.
This recognition ability, performed intuitively and
spontaneously, is one of the main functions of the human visual
system. Using various perceptual cues and multiple sensory
inputs we can identify a variety of objects instantly and
effortlessly. Unlike computer vision systems, the human visual
system is indifferent to changes in illumination, pose,
and scale. The neurophysiological procedures underlying the
recognition process are complex and use features such as
shape, color, and orientation. The primary visual cortex (V1)
generates a unique representation of these features that lead,
eventually, to the perceived object. Hence, in this research, a
biologically motivated recognition model is developed. Lowlevel
features of the image are extracted by appropriate filters,
in a manner similar to the human visual system, in which visual
information is sampled by the retina, passes through the
lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to the primary visual cortex
where low-level image features are represented. Additionally,
image intensities are converted to neuronal spike rates in accordance
with the visual system. The resulting spike trains
are fed into a recognition module which is also based on biological
concepts: its first stage is a biological neural network
which implements a neural microcircuit model, and its output
is fed into a standard artificial neural network for final
classification. The current experimental setup produces good
categorization results (eg, boats, cars, faces), and the use of a
biological neural network improves the recognition performance.
When compared to previous biological models, the
proposed recognition model yields improved recognition results
while being more consistent with physiological mechanisms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2631" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE INFLUENCE OF PHONOLOGICAL TRANSPARENCY

grapheme-to-lexicon route or a route in which the phonology
of words is first assembled via grapheme-to-phoneme
translation rules. Cognitive studies show that the choice of
route is influenced by proficiency, task, and word's phonological
transparency. Different languages differ in their extent
of phonological transparency. Hebrew has different levels
of transparency; pointed words are fully transparent, unpointed
word's transparency varies according to their degree
of freedom (DF)&#x02014;words with more &#x0201c;vowel letters&#x0201d; are more
transparent (low DF) and words with less are phonologically
ambiguous (high DF). In this fMRI study, subjects were
requested to covertly name words presented in a block design.
The first experiments included pointed and unpointed
words, and in the second experiment two levels of DF were
implemented. In both experiments two levels of word frequency
were used. Areas activated differentially by the word's pointedness were found in the occipital cortex, in the occipotemporal
region, and in the parietal cortex. Response
to words with different DF was tested in these areas. Volumes
in the parietal cortex were found to be sensitive to the
phonological transparency of words with similar activation
patterns in both experiments. Activation in this volume was
significantly higher when the phonological information was
present regardless of the frequency of the words. Furthermore
this volume was activated significantly higher by nonwords
rather than words. Further analysis showed that this
difference was significant only for high DF words. These results
show that the parietal region is involved in graphemeto-
phoneme conversion. This process is used for nonword
and when the word's phonology is transparent. The reading
system recruits the different routes according to the stimuli
in order to obtain efficient reading. Knowledge of these processes
may assist our understanding of reading disabilities.</p><p>

independent element of lexical structure or whether it simply
reflects a fine-tuning of the system to the statistical correlation
that exists among the orthographic and semantic properties
of words. Imaging studies in English failed to show
unequivocal morphological activation that is independent of
semantic or orthographic activation [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Cognitive research
in Hebrew has revealed that morphological decomposition
is an important component of print processing [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In Hebrew,
morphological relatedness does not necessarily induce
a clear semantic relatedness, thus, Hebrew provides a unique
opportunity to investigate the neural substrates of morphological
processing. In this fMRI study participants were required
to perform judgment tasks of morphological relatedness,
semantic relatedness, rhyming, and orthographic similarity.
Half of the morphologically related words were semantically
related and half were semantically unrelated. This design
was chosen to induce explicitmorphological processing.
A line pattern judgment task was used as a control. Words
were presented in block design. We identified two locations
involved in morphological processing: the lMFG and lIPS.
Comparing locations of morphologically related activation
to the locations of semantic and orthographic related activation,
we found that the areas neighbored but only partially
overlapped. Both morphological conditions displayed a similar
pattern of activation. These results coincide with the behavioral
data previously obtained in Hebrew, demonstrating
the important role of morphological processing in reading,
and suggest that morphological analysis is an independent
process of visual word recognition. Since our results show activation
that is independent of the semantic overlap between
words, the possibility that this activation results from semantic
factors seems unlikely.</p><p>

in memory formation. A loss of function of these receptors
may mediate such deficits. The goal of the present study was
to evaluate the effects of a single seizure on NMDA receptor
function in the rat hippocampus, using quantitative in vitro
autoradiography. Rats were induced to have a single generalized
tonic-clonic seizure by Flurothyl (2,2,2-Trifluoroethyl
ether) inhalation. Groups of 4-5 rats were sacrificed at various
time points (15 min to 7 days) after the seizure and
their brains processed for autoradiography. An intact control
group was included for comparison. Coronal cryostat sections
at the level of the hippocampus were incubated with
5 nM of the use dependent NMDA antagonist 3H-MK801;
without rinsing or addition of glutamate or glycine. Nonspecific
binding was assessed on consecutive sections incubated
with a large excess (100 microM) unlabeled MK801. Washed
and dried sections were scanned using a beta imager. Regional
analysis demonstrated a statistically significant, 20%&#x02013;
25% transient reduction in [3H]MK801 specific binding in
hippocampus (dorsal and ventral), entorhinal cortex and
temporal cortex 1 hour after the seizure. No reductions were
observed in the striatum and substantia nigra. Specific dorsal
hippocampal subfields (CA1 and dentate gyrus) showed a
more sustained reduction, which was still significant 4 hours
after the seizure. MK801 binding in all brain regions investigated
was similar to control levels by 8 hours after the seizure
and remained unchanged up to a week later. These results
show that a single seizure can cause a significant though
transient reduction in hippocampal, entorhinal, and temporal
cortical NMDA receptor function; which can explain the well documented amnesic effects observed acutely in the aftermath
of seizures in humans.</p><p>

characterized by pathological anxiety that usually occurs
after an individual experiences or witnesses severe trauma
that constitutes a threat to the physical integrity or life of the
individual or of another person. Disturbed sleep is a common
complaint among PTSD patients and has even been
referred to as the &#x0201c;hallmark&#x0201d; of PTSD. Both the safety and
the effectiveness of sleeping pills for treatment of insomnia
in PTSD patients are questionable. Daytime carryover effects
observed with longer-acting sleep medications are likely to
produce additional, potentially serious decrements in daytime
function among PTSD patients. Thus, emphasis should
be placed on nonpharmacological interventions to improve
sleep efficiency among these patients. Thus, in the present
study we examined the effects of music and muscle relaxation
therapies as treatment for insomnia in PTSD patients.
Thirteen PTSD patients participated in this randomized controlled
trail: 8 males and 5 females, mean age 45.7 years,
SD = 11.4. All of the participants suffered from insomnia
and exhibited actigraphically confirmed decreases in sleep efficiency.
Analysis revealed a significant increase in sleep efficiency
following music therapy, compared with baseline.
The results imply the beneficial effect of Music Therapy compared
to muscle relaxation therapy as treatment for insomnia
in PTSD patients.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3009" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FRONTAL ABNORMALITIES IN FIRST-EPISODE

<italic>Introduction</italic>. Accumulating evidence is pointing to structural
and functional impairments in the frontal lobe in
schizophrenia. Though, it is not clear what the relation between
the two levels of disturbance is. Advanced MRI allows
the combination of structural and functional measurements
in the same subject. <italic>Objective</italic>. The current study focused
on first-episode schizophrenia patients in order to identify
possible early onset brain pathology related to the frontal
lobe. We used DWI to evaluate WM integrity and organization.
In addition, fMRI was applied to measure brain response
to language task which allowed us to examine functional
asymmetry&#x02014;a principle neurodevelopmental organization
in the healthy brain.<italic>Method</italic>. Twelve first-episode
schizophrenia patients (ages 21&#x02013;45; 7M, 5F) and 12 matched
healthy controls (ages 23&#x02013;50; 7M, 5F) were scanned in a 1.5T
GE scanner. fMRI was acquired during auditory verb generation
and passive music listening tasks. DWI was based on
high b-value approach. <italic>Results</italic>. fMRI revealed less lateralization
in frontal language-related regions such as Broca's area
in schizophrenia patients compared to controls (P &#x0003c; .005).
Interestingly, this change in lateralization was due to relative
increase in activation in the right homologue region. High
b-value DWI demonstrated decrease white matter integrity
in the left frontal lobe region in schizophrenia patients compared
to healthy controls (based on ROI histogram analysis
(P &#x0003c; .05)). <italic>Conclusion</italic>. This study suggests that already in the
early stage of schizophrenia, MRI detects structural and functional
abnormalities in the frontal lobe. The fact that such
findings are observed at the first episode supports a possible
neurodevelopmental mechanism in schizophrenia.

afferents (SCA) induced a locomotor-like and tail-moving
rhythm in the isolated spinal cord of the neonatal rat and
mouse and that the SCA-induced locomotor rhythm depended
on synaptic activation of sacral interneurons whose
axons cross the cord and project rostrally mainly through
the contralateral ventral funiculus (VF). In the present study
we identified sacral interneurons with rostral projections
through the contralateral VF and examined their association
with SCA and nearby motoneurons in the neonatal
mouse spinal cord, using double and triple fluorescent labeling
techniques and two-photon confocal microscopy. The
activity pattern of these VF interneurons was then characterized
during SCA-induced rhythmic activity. In vitro retrograde
fluorescent labeling of the cut VF at the caudal end of the lumbar region (fluorescein dextran) revealed several
groups of S1&#x02013;S4 interneurons contralateral to the fill. Labeled
interneurons were mostly located in the intermediate
gray, a few in the dorsal horn, and some in the central
canal region and the ventral horn. Some of these interneurons
were contacted by anterogradely labeled (Texas red dextran)
SCA terminals, suggesting a direct monosynaptic afferent
innervation. Optical imaging studies of sacral interneurons
loaded with calcium green-dextran through the contralateral
VF revealed either tonic or rhythmic firing pattern
of these VF interneurons during SCA stimulation. The
discharge of VF interneurons was abolished by mu-opioid
receptor agonists and restored in the presence of naloxone.
The contribution of these sensory pathway interneurons
to pattern generation and inter-segmental communication
in the mammalian spinal cord should await further
studies.</p><p>

transmission while its own level depends on neuromuscular
activity. Because fast-twitch motor units are recruited
with increased motor demand, we examined the
regulation of AChE in predominantly fast-twitch rat muscles
before and following short strenuous treadmill training.
We have previously shown that the total AChE content
(per protein) increased in exercised fast- but not slowtwitch muscles.
Moreover, training significantly increased the
level of the AChE-tetramer (25%&#x02013;60%) in fast-twitch muscles
while the other AChE isoforms in both fast- and slowtwitch
muscles remained unchanged. To examine directly
whether synaptic AChE is influenced by muscle exercise,
EDL muscles of trained and control rats were double-labeled
for synaptic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) with TRITCalpha-
bungarotoxin and for AChE with biotin-fasciculin
(followed by FITC-streptavidin). Single fibers were isolated
and synaptic staining was assessed using confocal fluorescencemicroscopy.
Quantitative image analysis revealed a &#x0003e; 2-
fold increase in total synaptic AChE intensity and area with
a &#x0223c;10% elevation in AChE density at neuromuscular junctions
of the trained EDL muscles compared to untrained

changes in synaptic AChRs. We conclude that the short
strenuous training causes a selective increase in synaptic
AChE in fast-twitch leg muscles but not in AChRs, and that
following exercise, the elevated AChE-tetramer might become
a significant component at the endplates of fast-twitch

role and internal processes optimizing brain computational
processing potentiality, in normal and in parietal injury dysfunction
at 12 and 20 years post injury. Perceptual organization
was examined for such potency in processing complementary
local/global subcategories that differ in viewing
modes, but assumed on-line additive to a single basis of decision,
and cognate subcategories, additive within cognitive
internal process. Pattern recognition psychophysical testing
on differentiating multivariate stimuli upright/rotated, varying
in acuity demands, display time, display distance, viewing
modes showed highly accurate inverse (cc&#x02013;1) and direct
(cc+1) cross-correlation, in normal subjects at P &#x0003c; .05; in
parietal injury case at 12 years post injury high cross correlated
inverse reciprocities at P &#x0003c; .01, presumably one subcategory
attended to, commensurately, at expense of the other,
to accommodate attention deficiency. Pairing in direct and
in inverse reciprocities proved characteristic of these processing,
at various acuity demands and display times, in local
and global viewing. In normal subjects a commensurate
highly accurate inverse and direct reciprocity were observed;
rA versus rB inverse cross-correlation for the full range cc =
&#x02013;0.916 significant at P &#x0003c; .03 and direct cross correlation
cc = +0.96 verified in the data atP &#x0003c; .01. Parietal central role
is indicated in this computationally-based insight/rationale
saliency-determined strategy that allows economic sharing
or mutually compensatory processing, with a manifestation
of remarkable neuronal computational mathematical exactitude.
Decreased reciprocities at 20 years post injury suggested
deterioration in computational potency; lack of coherence
in face of cooccurrence in impairments allowed envisaging
distributed neural network relatable to proximity of

<italic>Background</italic>. Statin treatment is associated with a reduced
risk of developing AD and reduces amyloid deposition in
AD mouse models. No data is available regarding the effect
on NFT, the aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein which are the best correlate of dementia. <italic>Objective</italic>. To study
the effect of statins on NFT pathology in our tgmouse model
for NFT (mutant P301S/K257T tau protein). <italic>Methods</italic>. (a)
Mice receiving a low cholesterol diet (standard mouse diet)
were treated with simvastatin (BBB permeable) for 1 month.
(b) Mice receiving a high cholesterol diet (&#x0201c;Western countries'
diet&#x0201d;) were treated with atorvastatin (BBB impermeable),
for 5 months or with a nonstatin cholesterol lowering
agent (cholesterol-absorbance-inhibitor, CAI). Brain sections
were examined for NFT burden with Gallyas staining
and with AT8 and AT180 immunostainings (anti-202/205
and 231 phosphorylated tau residues), as well as for glia.
<italic>Results</italic>. One month treatment with simvastatin reduced the
NFT burden by 25% relative to nontreated controls (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;
.005), as indicated by Gallyas staining, as well as by AT8 and
AT180 Abs; with a 26% decrease in microglia (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001).
A larger decrease in NFT burden, 55%, was detected after
5 months with atorvastatin (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001), accompanied by a
20% reduction in microglia (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001). Interestingly, mice
treated with the nonstatin CAI showed a decrease only in
phosphorylated residue 231 (with AT180 Ab: 42%, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001)
but not in 202/205 (with AT8 Ab); with no decrease in glial
cells. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. (1) Statins significantly reduce NFT burden.
(2) The effect is irrespective of BBB permeability, suggesting
a peripheral emanating response. (3) The statin effect
is greater than with CAI, and is evident with low cholesterol
and with high cholesterol diet. This, together with the
decrease in microglia (involved in tau hyperphosphorylation),
suggests that the anti-NFT effect of statins is related to
their anti-inflammatory properties and not only to cholesterol
lowering.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3352" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PERCOLATION IN LIVING NEURAL NETWORKS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Breskin</surname><given-names>I. </given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Soriano</surname><given-names>J. </given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tlusty</surname><given-names>T. </given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Moses</surname><given-names>E. </given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group><aff>Physics of Complex Systems, Weizmann Institute of Science,

stimulation applied to the entire network through bath

measured with a calcium sensitive dye. Gradual addition of
CNQX blocks the neuro-receptors AMPA and decreases the
neural connectivity. The process of disintegration of the network
is described in terms of percolation on a graph, yielding
a quantification of the connectivity in the network. With no
CNQX the network comprises of one big cluster (giant component).
Increasing the CNQX concentration, the network
fragments into smaller clusters and the connectivity undergoes
a percolation transition. The giant component disintegrates
with a power law behavior, described by a universal
critical exponent beta = 0.65. By blocking the inhibitory
synapses with bicuculine, we show that beta is independent
of the balance between excitatory and inhibitory neurons.
This proves that it is an intrinsic property of the network. Together
with numerical simulations we show that the neural

to be involved in the pathogenesis of a subgroup of
children with tics and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD),
identified by the acronym PANDAS for pediatric autoimmune
neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal
infection. It has been suggested that antibodies produced
against group A beta-hemolytic streptococci (GABHS) cross
react with neural cells, in a process involving molecular
mimicry. Although PANDAS has received much attention in
recent years, no study to date assessed compulsive-like behaviors
in an animal model of GABHS-related neuropsychiatric
symptoms. The aim of the present study was therefore
to test the hypothesis that group A streptococcal infection
may lead to the emergence of OCD. To this end, Lewis rats
were immunized with an extract prepared fromGABHS, and
their compulsive behavior was assessed using two rat models
of OCD, namely, the signal attenuation model and the
induced grooming assay. Rats immunized with GABHS extract
had higher serumantibodies cross reactive with GABHS
compared to the control group; had IgG deposits in their
brains, primarily in the striatum and thalamus (control rats
brain showed low level, if any, of anti IgG immunolabeling);
and were more compulsive, that is, exhibited higher levels
of compulsive lever pressing and spent more time grooming
compared to the control group. These preliminary results
suggest that immunizing rats with GABHS extract can lead to
the emergence of compulsive behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3452" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CONSTITUTIVE GLIAL NITRIC-OXIDE RELEASE AND

in the brain by both neurons and astrocytes. NO is synthesized from L-arginine by several isoforms of the enzyme
nitric oxide synthase (NOS), depending on the conditions
and the cell type. Recently, we developed a method
to distinguish neurons from astrocytes using NO imaging in
brain slices with the NO indicator DAF-2DA and to demonstrate
NOS2-dependent astrocytic NO production that followed
neuronal fluorescence with a short delay of seconds to
few minutes that did not involved de-novo protein synthesis
(Buskila et al, 2005). Further examination of the function
of astrocytic NOS2 activity in the brain is made by studying
the NOS2 knockout mice (B6;129P2-NOS2TM1LAU/J,
Jackson Laboratory). These mice showed robust compensatory
NO production by neocortical astrocytes. The results
of the NO imaging and the NOS activity assays revealed that
the nature of the compensation was constitutive and Ca2+
dependent. Exploratory and stress behavioral tests of these
mice exhibit a clear behavioral phenotype in the NOS2 mutants
comparing to their littermate controls. We concluded
the following. (1) Astrocytes are capable of rapid and massive
NO production in response to acute neuronal death. (2)
The iNOS KO mouse exhibits compensatory astrocytic NO
release with a time course that is faster than in WT mice,
suggesting an activity of a constitutively expressed enzyme.
(3) iNOS KO mice exhibit specific behavioral modifications.
Our data indicate for the first time the possibility that astrocytic
NO release is involved in instantaneous management of
brain events.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3520" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ABNORMAL SIGNALS FROM THE PERIPHERAL

Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD 21205, USA</aff></front-stub><body><p>Neuropathic pain refers to chronic pain states where the generator
of pain stems from disease of the nervous system. One
common feature to each of these disease processes is that
they involve an axotomy. Accordingly, neuropathic pain can
be modeled in animals merely by cutting peripheral nerve
axons. Paradoxically, where one would think that axotomy
would simply induce a loss of sensation in the affected target
tissue (the skin), patients and animals actually develop hyperalgesia
(enhanced pain to stimuli). Patients may develop
allodynia, which is manifest as pain to light stroking stimuli.
This abnormality stems from central sensitization such
that tactile afferents acquire the capacity to activate painsignaling
cells in the dorsal horn and/or more rostral sites.
This sensitization is under dynamic control however, and
likely is maintained by abnormal inputs from the periphery.
From where do the abnormal inputs come? Candidates include
the nerve injury site (the neuroma), and the cell bodies
of the injured afferents in the dorsal root ganglion. But these
targets are not the whole story. For example, an L5 rhizotomy
after (or before) an L5 spinal nerve ligation does not abolish
hyperalgesia. This and other observations indicate that the
nociceptive afferents that are not involved in the injury, and
which share the innervation territory of the injured nerve,
develop spontaneous activity and become sensitized (&#x0201c;intact
nociceptor hypothesis&#x0201d;). This discovery provides a biological
rationale for why distal therapies (treatment directed, eg,
to the skin) may provide pain relief. Sensitization of the nociceptors
to catechols likely accounts for the abnormal coupling
of neural activity between sympathetic efferent fibers
and nociceptors seen in some neuropathic conditions. The
mechanism for the abnormal responses of the &#x0201c;intact&#x0201d; nociceptors
may relate to increased levels of trophic growth factors
in the denervated skin and Schwann cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3537" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LOSS OF AUTOIMMUNE T CELLS CORRELATES

discrimination implies long-term changes in sensory networks.
We have recently shown that both discrimination
thresholds and learning depend on the number of trials used
during training: intense sessions produce higher discrimination
thresholds possibly due to sensory adaptation. These
sessions reduce between-session learning, pointing to an interaction
between sensory adaptation and the generation
of long-term memory. Here we tested effects of perceptual learning on sensory adaptation. The standard texture stimulus
was used, briefly presented (40 ms) and backwardmasked
as by Karni and Sagi (1993). Observers decided whether an
array of 3 diagonal bars embedded in a background of horizontal
bars (19 &#x000d7; 19) was horizontal or vertical. One group
of subjects practiced the texture discrimination task with
12 trials/block and a second group practiced the task with
50 trials/block (more adaptation, previously shown to reduce
between-session learning). Both groups returned for an
additional intense test-session with 50 trials/block. Results
showed that the average threshold in the 50 trials/block testsession
was significantly lower for the subjects trained with
sessions of 12 trials/block, as compared to those trained with
sessions of 50 trials/block. These results show that short practice
sessions may have a role in reducing future suppressive
processes occurring in the following intense sessions, thereby
yielding efficient performance. We suggest a link between
memory generation and adaptation processes operating in
the visual network: short practice sessions with a stimulus
may have a role in generating an effective memory. The modified
network does not show the suppressive effects that are
related to within session adaptation. On this account, adaptation
is due to inefficient sensory processing. This proposed
link may have an essential role in the underlying mechanisms
of perceptual learning.</p><p>

operation of neurons and neural networks. We have shown
recently that key features of AP initiation in cortical neurons
in vivo, the step-like onset, and large variability of the onset
potential cannot be captured by the classical Hodgkin-
Huxley theory. Here we addressed the question, whether the
fast, step-like AP initiation dynamics is present in neocortical
neurons already at birth, or appears only later, during
the development? To this end, we recorded APs in neocortical
neurons (<italic>n</italic> = 149) in rat slices starting from the first
postnatal week to adult (P30). The AP initiation dynamics
changes dramatically during this period. In the first postnatal
week, the APs onset dynamics in most neurons was slow,
exponential-like, and thus compatible with the Hodgkin-
Huxley description. However, even as early as P4, some neurons
already expressed the step-like AP initiation dynamics,
which deviated clearly from the theoretically expected. The
proportion of such cells increased rapidly during the first
postnatal weeks, and after P17 all recorded cells exhibited the
fast, step-like AP initiation. The switch of the dynamics of
AP initiation was accompanied by modification of other AP
characteristics: a substantial increase of the maximal rate of
membrane potential change during the AP, a shift of the absolute
threshold towards more hyperpolarized values, a decrease
of the width, and a moderate increase of the amplitude.
Also basic electrophysiological properties of neuronal
membranes change during the development: the resting potential
became more hyperpolarized, and the input resistance
decreased. We conclude that the mechanisms, responsible
for the rapid, step-like AP initiation dynamics in neocortical
neurons are not present at birth, but develop during the 1&#x02013;3
postnatal weeks, in parallel with the maturation of the other
electrophysiological properties of neuronal membranes.</p><p>

that the inferior olive delivers to the cerebellar cortex
an error signal. This signal is then used to modify cerebellar
connections in a way that will prevent the reoccurrence
of the error. Experimental findings revealing the capacity of
olivary neurons to self generate regenerative patterns and to
synchronize those patterns over the network triggered the
idea that the inferior olive serves as a timing device for cerebellar
activity. The synchronized rhythmic behavior of olivary
output is still under debate. Although all the in vitro observations
unequivocally revealed subthreshold activity, the
auto-rhythmicity of complex spikes (cs) was observed only in
few studies. This discrepancy between the subthreshold oscillation
in the inferior olive observed in vitro and the sporadic
reports on rhythmicity of complex spikes, can only be reconciled
by recording directly from inferior olive neurons in
situ. Therefore, we performed intracellular recordings from
olivary neurons in vivo. We show that olivary activity under
in vivo conditions resembles that observed in vitro. Hence,
significant subthreshold oscillations (5&#x02013;12 Hz), organized in
epochs of 0.5 to several seconds, govern the membrane potential
of olivary neurons. The action potentials occur solely
during these epochs of oscillations. However, since these oscillatory
epochs are independent from one another and due
to the low firing rate of olivary neurons, it is only, seldom
that the 5&#x02013;12 Hz rhythmicity is revealed in the spikes autocorrelograms.
Thus, we conclude that indeed the inferior
olive oscillates in vivo and thus can serve as a timing device.
The output of the inferior olive is time locked to the underlying
oscillatory rhythm and most likely synchronized through
electrotonic connections between olivary neurons thus activating
in concert the cerebellar cortex.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3747" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A ZINC SENSING RECEPTOR MEDIATES ZINC

observed in the CA3-hippocampal and neocortical regions.
The Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ response was inhibited by the
Gq inhibitor, YM-245180, the PLC inhibitor, U73122, and
by emptying of intracellular Ca2+ stores using thapsigargin.
Thus, our results indicate that the Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ release
ismediated via a brain-ZnR which acts via the IP3 pathway.
We show that ZnR-responsive cells are not stained by
the astrocytic marker, SR101. Importantly, ZnR activity was
induced by endogenous Zn2+, released by electrical stimulation
of the mossy fibers, and attenuated in the presence of the
extracellular zinc chelator, CaEDTA. A similar reduction was
observed using the ZnT-3 KOmice, deficient of synaptic zinc.
The Zn2+-dependent Ca2+ response persisted in the presence
of the metabotropic glutamate receptor inhibitors. <italic>Conclusions</italic>.
Our results suggest that synaptically released zinc,
at the CA3 region, activates a specific zinc sensing receptor,
ZnR. Our work therefore suggests a role for zinc acting as a
neurotransmitter via a specific zinc sensing receptor located
on CA3 neurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3820" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>VOLTAGE-DEPENDENT INHIBITION OF K2P2.1

electric field as their currents are potassium selective and instantaneous
and their conductance is independent of membrane
potential. Leak currents play a critical role in determining
cell resting membrane potential and thus controlling
nerve and muscle excitability. K2P2.1 (KCNK2, TREK-
1), a member of the 2P-domain K+ channel (K2P) family,
is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous system,
as well as in the heart, kidney, and testis tissues. K2P2.1 activity
is regulated by a variety of physical and chemical effectors
including temperature, fatty acids, internal pH, mechanical
stretch, and phosphorylation. Although K2P2.1 is
classified as a leak channel, it was shown to posses an exceptional
capability to reversibly convert between leak- and
voltage-dependent phenotypes. This unique behavior can
be mediated by phosphorylation of a unique serine at the
carboxy-terminal tail of the channel. Here, we report that
human K2P2.1 channel is strongly inhibited by external acidosis
in a potassium-dependant manner (pKa = 7.3 at
4 mM external potassium). Two histidine residues (H87 and
H141), located at the first external turret loop of the channel,
were found to be crucial for proton sensitivity at physiological
range. Interestingly, external pH (pHo) sensitivity
was voltage-dependent, being more prominent at negative
potentials. In addition, a mutant channel mimicking a constantly
phosphorylated channel was significantly more inhibited
by pHo than a mutant mimicking a constantly nonphosphorylated
channel. Moreover, the voltage dependency
of K2P2.1 was significantly reduced in the pHo insensitive
mutant, turning it into an open rectifier channel. Taken together,
our data suggest that conversion of the K2P2.1 channel
between leak and voltage-dependent phenotypes involves
an external pH sensor, identified here for the first time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3855" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>AN ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF

such as the Morris water maze and olfactory-discrimination
learning in four-armed maze, is accompanied by long-lasting
enhanced neuronal excitability, which results from reduction
in the post burst afterhypolrization (AHP) in pyramidal
neurons. It has been suggested that AHP reduction is
not a mechanism by which specific memories are stored.
Rather, it enables the cortical network to enter into a learning
mode, in which new memories can be stored rapidly and
efficiently. Here we examined whether learning of a &#x0201c;simple&#x0201d;
task within few trial in a single session would also result
with such modifications. Our hypothesis was that such
simple tasks would not be accompanied by intrinsic modifications.
Rats were required to associate a specific odor with
water reward in an open box. This task is rapidly acquired
and well remembered over several days. Intracellular recordings
were preformed in layer II piriform cortex pyramidal
neurons, in brain slices, 12 hours, 1 day or 3 days after learning.
In contrast to our observations after complex olfactory

spongiform encephalopathy (TSE), a fatal neurodegenerative
disease of humans and animals. When the disease is acquired
following the consumption of infectedmeat, the common
dogma claims for neuroinvasion of the prion via neural
pathways (vague and splanchnic nerves), which is usually
preceded by the prion propagation into secondary lymphoid
organs. The goal of this study was to examine the possibility
that prion enters the brain directly from the blood stream
by crossing the blood brain barrier (BBB). For this purpose
we made use of an in vitro model of the BBB composed of
primary cultured porcine brain microvessel endothelial cells
seeded on semi-permeable membrane. Upon coculture with astrocytes the endothelial cells acquire a typical BBB feature,
that is, high trans endothelial electrical resistance (TEER) of
above 400 ohm&#x000d7;cm2. The interaction of the synthetic peptide
corresponding to the 106&#x02013;126 amyloidogenic region of
the cellular human prion protein (PrPC) with the BBB was
examined. This peptide is widely used in prion studies due
to its biophysical properties resembling the infectious form
of prion protein (prpsc). The prp 106&#x02013;126 was observed to
prevent the formation of high TEER when added 48 hours
after the onset of the coculture with astrocytes. If added to
the endothelial culture when a high TEER was achieved, the
prp 106&#x02013;126 was found to significantly decrease the TEER by
about 50%. The effects were sequence specific as the scrambled
prp 106&#x02013;126 peptide did not produce any effect. Moreover,
the effect on the BBB was blood-side specific implying
that a prion penetrating into the brain via the blood stream
is a plausible event. This possibility raises questions about
the risk of iatrogenic prion spread through blood transfusions

The cannabinoid system controls systemic

cardiac and smooth muscle and play important roles in neuronal functions. The main subunit of these channels,
Cav1.2, is encoded by a multiexon gene (more than 50 exons).
Alternative splicing gives rise tomany isoforms that appear
to be tissue-specific. Human Cav1.2 gene has two alternative
initial exons that encode two channel isoforms: long
NT alpha 1C starting with 46-amino acid (aa) encoded by
exon 1a, and a short-NT Cav1.2 staring with 16-aa encoded
by the alternative exon 1. The long-NT Cav1.2 is predominant
in the heart, short-NT isoforms prevail in smooth muscle
and brain. We show that the initial segment of the long-
NT Cav1.2 is an inhibitory module (NTI module) that reduces
the maximal open probability, Po, max, and its deletion
greatly increases Ca2+ or Ba2+ currents via L-type channels.
Removal of the NTI module reduces the enhancement
of currents caused by coexpression of the beta subunit, Cavb.
However, purified NT does not interact with the beta
subunit, suggesting an allosteric effect. By mutagenesis we
mapped the NTI module to the first 20 amino acids of the
long-NT and demonstrated that only the cardiac but not the
brain/smoothmuscle isoformpossesses that NTI module. By
measurements of channel currents, surface expression and
single-channel properties, we found that the NT inhibitory
module exclusively regulates a single function of the Cav-b
subunit: the increase in Po, max. The NT of Cav1.2 contains
binding sites for calmodulin (CaM) and for the neuronal
Ca2+-binding protein 1, CaBP1, but the function of these
sites is not known. CaBP1 counteracts the CaM-dependent
channel inactivation caused by Ca2+ influx. Deletions in NT
lessen the effect of CaBP1 by shifting the voltage dependency
of components of Ca-dependent inactivation. We propose
a model that provides a framework in which to study how
the cytosolic segments of Cav1.2, the beta subunit, CaM, and
CaBP1 regulate channel function.</p><p>

that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder.
Based on evidence of abnormalities in nitric oxide (NO) system
in schizophrenia that are of a neurodevelopmental origin,
we investigated the effects of early postnatal NO synthase
(NOS) inhibition on the development of latent inhibition
(LI) in rats. LI is a cross-species phenomenon, in which repeated
nonreinforced preexposure to a stimulus results in the
development of inattention to the stimulus, which interferes
with its subsequent conditioning. We found that neonatal
NOS inhibition did not affect LI at prepubertal age, but led
to the emergence of an abnormally persistent LI at adulthood
in male but not in female rats. Because attentional perseveration
and gender differences are associated with negative
symptomatology, abnormally persistent LI following neonatal
NOS inhibition may be relevant to this symptomatology.
In support, this cognitive abnormality exhibited a pharmacological
profile characteristic of negative symptoms, whereby
it was reversed by drugs enhancing NMDA receptor function
glycine and D-cycloserine and by clozapine but not by
haloperidol. In addition, we found that NOS inhibition led
to decreased sensitivity to the locomotor-stimulating effects
of amphetamine and this effect was evident already at prepubertal
age, possibly representing a &#x0201c;prodromal state&#x0201d; fully

NOS inhibition May provide a neurodevelopmental model of

neuronal excitability by limiting repetitive firing. The
KCNQ2/Q3 channel complex was identified as the molecular
correlate of the M-current. Mutations of the KCNQ2 and
KCNQ3 genes lead to BFNC, a neonatal form of epilepsy.
The objective of this research was to evaluate the impact
of M-channels on neuronal excitability and transmitter release
in hippocampal neurons. Spontaneous excitatory and
inhibitory post synaptic currents (sEPSCs and sIPSCs) were
recorded from cultured primary hippocampal neurons. The
impact of the M-channels on sEPSCs and sIPSCs was evaluated
using the inhibitor linopirdine, and the openers retigabine
and diclofenac. Our results indicate that blockade of
the M-channel activity by linopirdine markedly enhances the
frequency of sEPSCs and sIPSCs. On the contrary, enhancing
the M-channel activity markedly reduces the frequency
of sEPSCs and sIPSCs. In addition, the spiking pattern of
sEPSCs was changed following the addition of M-current
blocker or openers. The impact of the M-channels on miniature
EPSCs (mEPSCs) of hippocampal neurons was also
evaluated. Preliminary results indicate that blockade of the
M-channel activity by linopirdine enhanced the frequency of
mEPSCs in two out of seven cells. Immunocytochemical experiments
indicate the presence of KCNQ2 subunits in both
glutamatergic and GABAergic hippocampal neurons as identified
with antibodies directed against the synaptic markers
vGlut1 and GAD 65, respectively. In addition to its somatic location, substantial KCNQ2 immunoreactivity was clearly
co-localized with vGlut1 and GAD 65 at synaptic varicosities.
In all, our data indicate that in addition to their somatic/
axonal location, presynaptic M-channels may play a
substantial role in regulating the release of glutamate and
GABA to dampen neuronal excitability.</p><p>

oxide-activated enzyme soluble guanylyl cyclase (SGC).
Functional SGC is a heterodimeric dimeric protein comprised
of an alpha subunit and a beta subunit. Elphick and
Jones (1998) developed antibodies to a conserved region of
Drosophila SGC alpha to investigate the expression of this
subunit in the locust nervous system. Three antisera, XA4,
XB3, and XC3, recognized a SGC alpha-like protein (circa
65 kDa) in locust tissue (Elphick and Jones, 1998). Immunocytochemical
analysis of locust brain with XA4 and XC3,
but not with XB3, revealed staining in antennal mechanoreceptors
and in antennal lobe olfactory interneurons. In the
retina of locust eyes very strong staining was observed in the
perirhabdomeric compartment of each ommatidium, suggesting
that SGC may be involved in locust phototransduction.
However, 65 kDa is less than the molecular mass of
Drosophila SGC alpha (circa 75 kDa; Shah and Hyde, 1995).
Moreover, the expression levels of the putative SGC alpha
subunit in locust photoreceptor cells could not explain the
twofold nitric oxide donor induced increase in cGMP levels
in locust eyes (Jones and Elphick, 1999) that seemed very low
in comparison to what was reported for other species (Shah
and Hyde, 1995; Stone and Marletta, 1994). Using Western
blot analysis of tissue homogenates of wild type and SGC alpha
mutant Drosophila we thus first established that the antisera
against the X-peptide region in Drosophila SGC alpha
do recognise this subunit in flies. This analysis revealed that
XB3, but not XA4 or XC3, is the most specific of the available
X-peptide antisera. Using XB3 antisera we then reinvestigated
the expression pattern of the SGC alpha-like protein
in locust brain and eye tissue. It appears that this subunit
might not be as abundant as previously assumed, shedding
a different light on the role of NO-cGMP signaling in locust
phototransduction.</p><p>

brain mapping techniques (in particular fMRI) underscores
the importance of detailed, physiologically realistic, hemodynamic
response models. The accuracy of such models has,
however, remained limited due to an incomplete characterization
of the various response components and their interplay.
Their improvement requires measures at fine spatial
scales, allowed by optical imaging techniques. Here, we
present a new method based on computer vision algorithms
to record cerebral blood flow (CBF) at micro-vascular resolution,
by tracking moving red blood cells (RBCs) in individual
vessels of the superficial cortical vasculature and estimating
their velocity, from high spatiotemporal resolution
(15micron, 5ms) optical imaging data. Experiments were
held on the awake, fixating monkey, recording in the primary
visual cortex. Using the periodic modulation of the
CBF by the heart beat as a gauge signal, we first tested our
motion extraction algorithms by comparison with simultaneously
performed laser doppler CBF measurements. The
much smaller CBF responses to a visual stimulus could also
be detected, in individual elements of the cortical microvasculature.
The results indicate the presence of compartmentspecific
responses. Further development of the image processing
algorithms such as automatic vessel selection will
allow obtaining high-resolution CBF maps. Those will be
useful to characterize, at fine spatial scale, the vascular dynamics
resulting from neuronal activation, thus providing
(i) phenomenological input for constraining multicompartment
hemodynamic response models, as well as (ii) further
insights on which part of the active vascular response best
colocalizes with sites of increased neuronal activity.</p><p>

partially blocks the flow of afferent information from the periphery to the central nervous system. When this occurs,
we expect there to be a loss, or at least a blunting, of sensation.
Yet clinical experience shows that neural injury is frequently
accompanied by amplified and distorted sensation in
the form of allodynia, hyperalgesia, hyperpathia, and ongoing
neuropathic pain. At its most extreme, for example, in
the case of phantom limb pain in amputees, traumatic neuropathy
appears to create elaborate sensations from no input
at all. Accumulating evidence points to abnormal discharge
originating in the peripheral nervous system as both a primary
nociceptive signal, and as a factor that triggers and dynamically
maintains central sensitization. This motivates examination
of the causes of the abnormal discharge. Axotomy
induces altered regulation of gene expression in primary sensory
neurons in the affected dorsal root ganglia (DRGs), and
to a certain extent, in intact neighboring ganglia. Key among
these changes are alterations in the expresssion of ion channels
and the consequent emergence of high-frequency subthreshold
oscillatory potentials and depolarizing afterpotentials
(DAPs). The emergence of intrinsic resonant properties
in these neurons alters their fundamental impulse generating
capability, and promotes abnormal repetitive firing. Axotomy
also triggers a change in the expression of certain peptide
neurotransmitters which may render neurons that formerly
triggered only touch sensation now to trigger pain. Individual
and strain differences have been identified in the
extent to which these phenotypic changes occur. A consequence
is major heritable differences in susceptibility to neuropathic
pain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4425" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ROLE OF PKC IN GNRH ACTIVATION OF

examined in gonadotrope cell lines. Incubation of the cells
with GnRH resulted in a protracted activation of ERK1/2 and
a slower and transient activation of JNK1/2. GnRH induced a
rapid (1&#x02013;3 minutes) translocation of PKCalpha to the membrane,
followed by redistribution to the cytosol. PKCdelta
and PKCepsilon seem to localize to the golgi, followed by redistribution
to the perinuclear zone and a slow translocation
to the membrane (30 minutes) in GnRH-treated cells. The
pan PKC isoforms inhibitor, GF 109203X, nearly abolished
GnRH stimulation of ERK1/2, but only reduced JNK1/2
activation by 50%. The cPKC inhibitor, Go 6976, reduced
GnRH stimulation of ERK1, but markedly inhibited ERK2
activation and abolished GnRH stimulation of JNK1/2. The
selective PKCdelta inhibitor, rottlerin, markedly inhibited
GnRH stimulation of ERK1/2 with little effect on JNK1/2. GF
109203X abolished TPA-stimulation of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2.
As with GnRH, Go 6976 was a more potent inhibitor of
TPA stimulation of ERK2 (60%) versus ERK1 (20%), but
JNK1/2 activation was abolished. Unlike GnRH, rottlerin reduced
significantly TPA signaling to JNK1/2. Coexpression
of GFP epitope-tagged ERK and dominant negative plasmids
of PKCalpha and PKCdelta revealed that PKCalpha plays a
partial role in ERK activation by GnRH, with a prominent
role for PKCdelta. A cPKC isoform is involved in both GnRH
and TPA-stimulation of JNK1/2, while PKCdelta participates
in TPA but not in GnRH signaling to JNK1/2. Comparing
the alphaT3-1 to the more mature LbetaT-2 gonadotropes
revealed that the role of PKC in GnRH to ERK signaling diminishes
with maturation of pituitary gonadotropes and the
maturation has produced a switch in the relative sensitivity
of ERK1 versus ERK2 to the PKC isoforms inhibitors. The
above data suggest that GnRH and TPA activate ERK and
JNK by common and separate PKC isoforms and indicate for
the first time differential role of PKC in ERK1 versus ERK2
activation.</p><p>

(AD), is associated with increased deposition of amyloidbeta
(Abeta). Recent evidence suggests that the pathological
effects of Abeta are mediated by soluble oligomers which
are formed during the early stages of the amyloid cascade.
The objective of our work was to characterize the initial aggregation
stages of Abeta in vivo and the effects thereon of
apoE4. This was performed by prolonged inhibition of the
Abeta degrading enzyme neprilysin and examination of the
resulting effects on the levels, sizes, and chemical composition
of brain Abeta oligomers in apoE transgenic mice. This
revealed that the total levels of soluble Abeta increased similarly
and progressively for at least one month in brains of
apoE4 transgenic mice and of transgenic mice which express
the AD benign allele, apoE3. In contrast, the extent and kinetics
of oligomerization of Abeta were markedly affected
by the apoE genotype. The extent to which soluble Abeta
oligomerize was first examined by size filtration. This revealed
the occurrence of a population of Abeta oligomers of
which those sized about 30&#x02013;50 kD were specifically elevated
in apoE4 mice. Characterization of these apoE4 stimulated
oligomers and determination of their exact size and cellular
location revealed that they are composed of SDS stable bands
with apparent molecular weight of 40 and 55 kD which were
particularly elevated intracellularly. Parallel measurements revealed that the levels of intact apoE were similar in the
apoE3 and apoE4mice. In contrast, the extent of apoE degradation
was specifically elevated intracellularly in the apoE4
mice. These findings suggest that the 40 and 55 kD Abeta
oligomers are preferentially stabilized by apoE4 intracellularly
and that these oligomers may mediate the pathological
effects of apoE4. The mechanism underlying the stimulation
of Abeta oligomerization by apoE4 and the role of apoE fragmentation
in this process will be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4503" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE EFFECT OF COMBINED ADMINISTRATION OF

previously shown to reverse the escitalopram-induced inhibition
of norepinephrine (NE) neuronal firing activity (Psychopharmacol
181 : 126, 2005; Dremencov et al, Biol Psychiatry
Epub 2006, August 23). Thus, nonresponse to selective
serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in some
depressive patients may be explained by a decreased NE tone
and the beneficial effect of atypical antipsychotics by its reversal.
The present study aimed to determine if paliperidone
(the 9-OH metabolite of risperidone) exerts distinct effects
on 5-HT and NE neuronal activity fromthose of risperidone.
It was found that the acute administration of risperidone
(0.4 mg/kg, IV) produced a robust inhibition of firing rate of
5-HT neurons. This inhibition was partially reversed by the
NE reuptake inhibitor desipramine (5 mg/kg, IV) or by the
5-HT1A antagonist WAY 100635 (0.1 mg/kg, IV) and completely
reversed when both WAY 100635 and desipramine
were given. The same degree of inhibition of 5-HT neurons
was observed after 2 or 14 days of risperidone administration
(1 mg/kg/d, SC). However, 1 mg/kg/d of paliperidone
did not alter the firing rate of 5-HT neurons neither after 2
or 14 days of administration. Paliperidone, as observed with
risperidone, did not alter the firing rate of NE neurons by itself
but reversed the escitalopram-induced suppression of NE
neuronal firing after 2 or 14 days of coadministration. However,
differently from risperidone, paliperidone coadministered
with escitalopram did not elevate the firing rate of NE
neurons above the value of control animals (after 2 days of
administration) and did not alter the effect of sustained escitalopram
administration on 5-HT neuronal firing activity.
The capacity of paliperidone to reverse the SSRI-induced inhibition
of NE neuronal firing rate, without decreasing 5-HT
neuronal activity, suggests that paliperidone may be beneficial
in SSRI-resistant depression.</p><p>

a paralog protein to activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
(ADNP). ADNP is an 1102 amino acid protein, with
widespread expression in the brain. It was found that ADNP
protects neurons from various damages and is essential to
brain formation and to neural tube closure. KIAA0863, its
paralog protein, has 33% identity and 46% similarity with
ADNP. Like ADNP, the protein contains zinc fingers motifs
and a homodomain profile, which characterize transcription
factors. KIAA0863 is ubiquitously expressed in the mouse tissues,
especially in the brain. Its messenger RNA has been detected
from developmental day 7.5 until birth. In the mouse
brain, high levels of KIAA0863 gene expression have been
noted. These high levels were sustained through embryogenesis
and adulthood. In cancerous tissues such as breast
and colon cancer, an increased expression level of KIAA0863
has been found (Michal Kushnir, MS Thesis). Knock down
of KIAA0863 using RNA interference technology in P19
cells caused inhibition of the cell proliferation. When P19
cells were treated with hydrogen peroxide, knock down of
KIAA0863 reduced its toxicity and improved cell survival.
Due to the similarity between KIAA0863 and ADNP, and because
of the involvement of KIAA0863 in proliferation and
cell death processes, we believe that this gene has a critical
role in the nervous system. Understanding of KIAA0863
function and mechanism may shed light on processes related
with cell death, neuronal protection, and cancer. In ongoing
experiments, we are examining the effect of KIAA0863 knock
down on the proapoptotic protein, P53.</p><p>

and butyrylcholinesterase (pseudocholinesterase, BuChE)
and are abundant in the nervous system and other tissues.
While the role of AChE in terminating cholinergic transmission
is well established, the role of BuChE is not clear, although it can substitute for AChE in neurotransmission
(eg, in AChE knockout) and acts as a scavenger for anticholinesterases.
Recent evidence suggests that both enzymes
may function in normal development of the nervous systemand
participate in neurodegenerative diseases. Our study
examines the involvement of ChEs in the pathologies of
dystrophin-deficient mutant (mdx) mice, the animal model
of Duchennemuscular dystrophy. We have previously shown
that adult female mdx muscles are malformed with distorted
neuromuscular junctions and impaired regulation of acetylcholine
receptors. Furthermore, the BuChE activity in female
mdx sera was significantly lower than in wild-type (wt). Because
serum BuChE in rats is modulated by gonadal steroids
and is down-regulated via circulating testosterone (T) in
males, we tested such an influence in mdx mutants. Sera
of adult (17&#x02013;23 weeks old), male mdx and wt mice were
assayed for BuChE activities by hydrolysis of butyryl- and
acetyl-thiocholine substrates, using selective inhibitors. We
first confirmed that BuChE is also reduced in male mdx sera
when compared to wt. Second, to determine the effect of removal
of T on male ChE levels, we examined mdx and wt
sera 6 days after orchidectomy. While total BuChE activity in
wt sera increased by almost 19%, the BuChE levels in mdx
sera stayed unchanged after castration, thus remaining significantly
below normal wt level and almost 30% lower than
wt-castrate. Together, it is possible that the lack of dystrophin
in mdx-mice affects the endocrine regulation of circulating
BuChE. The endocrine regulation of ChEs is further investigated
at the level of neuromuscular junctions in mdx and
wt-mice.</p><p>

In this work we have analyzed the directional tuning
of single units recorded in motor cortex of monkeys performing
a center-out task. We have found distinctive distributions
of tuning shape parameters such as mean firing rates
and modulation amplitude, and strong positive correlations
between them. In order to explain these findings we propose
a model that assumes that the synaptic inputs to different
neurons are Gaussian sourcesmodulated by independent
neuronal gain. The parameters of the Gaussian distributions
of sources as well as the shape of the gain distribution were
estimated by the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm.
We find that the resultant statistical model accounts for the
observed shape of histograms of tuning properties as well as
their correlations. We propose that gain modulation plays an
important role in the diverse response properties of cortical
neurons. Our work offers a useful method of recovering such
factors from the observed distribution of responses in cortical
populations.</p><p>

produce coordinated rhythmic patterns was studied in isolated
brainstem spinal cord preparations of neonatal rats,
using bilateral recordings from sacral and from flexor- and
extensor-dominated lumbar ventral roots, and intracellular
recordings from spinal motoneurons. Elevation of the
endogenous concentration of ACh by application of the
cholinesterase blocker edrophonium (Edro) produced nonstationary
rhythmic activity in the thoracolumbar (TL) and
sacrocaudal (SC) segments. Cross-wavelet analysis of the
data revealed epochs of locomotor-like activity (left-right +
flexor extensor alternation, 26% of the preparations) followed
either by alternating left-right pattern with flexorextensor
synchronicity, bilaterally synchronous rhythm, or
irregular bursting patterns. The TL and SC rhythms exhibited
strong longitudinal coupling under these conditions.
Specific application of Edro/ACh to the TL or SC segments
produced bursting activity only in the segments onto which
the drugs were added. Stimulation of SC-afferents or the ventromedial
medulla in the presence of Edro/ACh produced
locomotor-like activity and alternating left-right bursting in
the TL and SC segments, respectively. Immunocytochemical
studies revealed clusters of cholinergic ventral horn and central
canal-adjacent neurons in all studied segments (L2, L5,
S1, S2). Cholinergic neurons were also found in the intermediolateral
and sacral parasympathetic nuclei of L2 and S1.
ACh is suggested to activate various components of the pattern
generating circuitry at the TL and SC spinal segments
and thereby produce diverse rhythmic patterns. The coupling
between the rostral and caudal rhythmogenic networks
is achieved only as the excitability of the TL and SC networks
is elevated simultaneously. The association between the identified
clusters of cholinergic neurons described above and the
ACh induced motor patterns will be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4875" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITYWITHIN THE DISTRIBUTED

inferior occipital gyrus separately and directly influencing
ventral (fusiform gyrus) and dorsal (superior temporal sulcus)
regions. To investigate the interaction between the core

compared, varying either fusiform gyrus or superior temporal
sulcus influence on each region of the extended system.
We found that the fusiform gyrus provided the dominant
causal influence on the amygdala, inferior frontal gyrus

within the extended system showed that emotional
faces increased coupling between the fusiform gyrus and the

different states of arousal (alertness, quiet wakefulness, sleep,
etc). What are the systematic differences in the cortical activity
which constitute such states? We reason that two types
of differences should exist: (1) within a state instances of activity
should exhibit characteristic structure, as indicated by
macroscopic measurements of the cerebral electrical activity
(ie, EEG), (2) the structure of the activity sets associated
with different states should reflect the difference in the organism's
perceptual (and cognitive) capacity given its state
of arousal. To explore these ideas we analyze voltage sensitive
dye imaging data recorded from a primate in three conditions
(1) under anesthesia, (2) with closed eyes, and (3)
while viewing visual stimuli. To explore the first question
we extract from frames captured during 1- second recordings
measures pertaining to characteristic structure, such as
measurements of randomness and typical correlation structures.
In order to characterize the structure of activity sets we
employ different measures to probe the data ranging from
quantitative (computation of homology) to more qualitative
means which allow for visualization (such as geometric diffusion
techniques). We find that given a state, cortical activity does indeed exhibit characteristic structure: activity becomes
less random, more regularly distributed in space and time,
more correlated, and has typical distribution of spectral energy
in specific spatial-temporal bands, as arousal increases
(eg, (1)&#x021d2;(2)&#x021d2;(3)). These phenomena are very robust and
thus allow not only perfect classification of activity according
to state, but also noticeable confidence margins. Also, we
show preliminary results lending some support to the idea
that the structure (eg, the topology and geometry) of activity
sets is markedly different between the conditions examined.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5256" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>POLYAMINES: ENDOGENOUS BLOCKERS OF Na

a central role in initiation and propagation of action potentials.
The same channels give a rise to a more slowly inactivating,
persistent Na current, whose functional importance
relates to dynamic control of the neuronal input-output relationship.
Here, We present the first evidence that the availability
of both transient and late Na channels in neocortical
neurons is controlled by ubiquitous polyamine (PA) substances,
spermine, and spermidine. We also show that while
somatodendritic Na channels are extremely sensitive to PA
modulation, the axonal channels (presumably Nav1.6) are either
less sensitive or resistant. These findings identify a novel

CB1 receptor in newborn mice interferes with the initiation
of milk suckling and thus severely impairs growth and development.
These studies utilized the CB1 receptor antagonist/
inverse agonist rimonabant (SR141716) and suggested
that an oral-motor deficit underlies the impaired suckling.
However, generalmotor development was also affected by rimonabant.
Here, we extend our observations (1) on the role
of the sucking mechanism in the growth deficit and (2) to
affirm neutral blockade of the CB1 receptor, as opposed to
an inverse agonism mechanism by the use of a novel, neutral
CB1 antagonist. Experiment 1. Pups were injected with
rimonabant (10&#x02013;20 mg/kg). In order to investigate whether
CB1 receptor blockade impairs sucking, independently of a
generalmotor deficit, neonates were placed in a dish containing
amilk/creammixture. Growth and survival were now significantly
improved in rimonabant-treated pups. Experiment
2. Pups were injected with HS1 (12.5&#x02013;25 mg/kg) and were
assessed daily for weight gain, milk ingestion, and body temperature.
Significant developmental delays were recorded in
the HS1 pups. Conclusions. (a) Neutral CB1 receptor antagonism
is responsible for the rimonabant/HB1-induced growth failure and (b) oral motor competence is the psychobiological
mechanism underlying the impaired feeding in the
CB1 receptor-blocked pups. Further, &#x0201c;Nonorganic failureto-
thrive&#x0201d; (NOFTT) afflicts 2&#x02013;4% of infants and is characterized
by growth failure without any known organic cause.
Researchers have hypothesized a &#x0201c;biological vulnerability&#x0201d;
leading to hypotonia, deficient oral-motor function and impaired
suckling. Our studies suggest that the syndrome observed
in newborn pups with blocked CB1 receptors may
serve as the first animal model for NOFTT.</p><p>

pathologies inherent in Alzheimer's disease (AD), including
APP processing, amyloid-beta aggregation and release of
cytokines. We have shown that the membrane active metal
chelator (MAC) DP-109 inhibits plaque formation in aged
female APP-transgenic Tg2576 mice [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], as well as reduces
the release of Il-1b and TNFa from microglia. The question
remains as to whether such treatment can reduce or
prevent memory loss? We tested a triple transgenic mouse
model (3xTgAD) of AD, expressing mutations in presenilin-
1, APP (Swedish mutation) and tau (P301L), at 5&#x02013;9 and
14&#x02013;18 months of age. Mice were administered either vehicle,
DP-109 (5 mg/kg/day), or DP-460 (10mg/kg/day), po
starting at 5 or 14mo of age for 3 months, followed by
Morris water maze testing (MWM) while continuing treatment.
Nine mo mice learned to find the hidden platform
in the MWM with no memory impairment nor any significant
difference between the groups, whereas 18 mo 3xTgAD
mice did demonstrate significant memory acquisition impairments.
On the fourth day of the MWM trial, mice treated
with the MAC molecules demonstrated a significantly improved
ability to find the hidden platform as compared to
the na&#x000ef;ve and vehicle-treated mice, 20 &#x000b1; 4 s versus 37 &#x000b1; 4.6 s,
<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01, respectively. By the fifth day of testing DP-109 and
DP-460 treated mice acquired the hidden platform as effectively
as did the 9 mo old mice. Performance in the probe trial
task was also significantly improved in aged mice treated with
DP-109 and DP-460. The swimming speed remained fairly
constant across the groups. These results further support the
idea that endogenous metals contribute to the pathology of
AD and that administration of therapeutic agents, even after
the reported onset of AD pathology, can reverse progressive
memory loss in 3xTg-AD mice. Lipophilic metal chelators
such as DP-109 and DP-460 appear to be promising therapeutic
agents against AD.</p><p>

of proteins. The aim of our work is to investigate the role of
DOC2 in the exocytosis process. DOC2 protein family contains
3 isoforms which have two tandem C2 domains; C2
domains associate with phospholipids in Ca2+-dependent
manner. We use adrenal chromaffin cells as our model system
for neurosecretion and overexpressed DOC2 in these
cells using the Semliki Forest Virus system. Both DOC2A and
-B have high calcium sensitivity; they translocated from the
cytosol to the plasma membrane at extremely low [Ca2+]i,
half-maximal translocation occurred at 478 nM and 175 nM
[Ca2+]i for DOC2A and -B, respectively. Thus, DOC2A and
-B are extremely sensitive to small changes in [Ca2+]i. These
changes occur when the vesicles in the neurosecretory cell
undergo priming. We hypothesized that DOC2 affects exocytosis
and that its translocation has a physiological role.
Therefore we created a mutant DOC2B that is constantly at
the plasma membrane. To check the differences between the
effect of the wt and the mutant DOC2B on the exocytotic response,
we performed amperometry experiments where we
depolarized the cells using KCl in a repetitive manner. Both
wt andmutant DOC2B enhanced exocytosis in the first stimulation.
Yet, while the wt DOC2B increased the exocytotic
response in a constant manner throughout the six applications,
the ability of the mutant DOC2B to increase the exocytotic
response decreased within each application. This suggests
that translocation of DOC2B is important for its activity.
To pinpoint the exact step where DOC2B is involved, we
used membrane capacitancemeasurements and flash photolysis
of caged-Ca2+. We found that the wt DOC2B increased
the fast burst, while the mutant DOC2B had a smaller effect
on the fast burst. The second flash revealed that while the wt
DOC2B increased the effect, the mutant did not differ from
control cells. Our results suggest that DOC2B modulates the
exocytotic response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5621" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>BRAIN NETWORK SUPPORTING LONG-TERM

commonly studied using paradigms employing individual
trials devoid of a continuous context outside of the laboratory
setting. In contrast, real-life episodic memory is the result
of on-going encoding within a highly contextualized and
dynamically changing framework. In order to investigate human Memory
under conditions that more closely mimic reallife
encoding situations, we had subjects view on audio-visual
TV sitcom while undergoing fMRI scanning and eye-motion
monitoring. Three weeks later, a subsequent memory test,
comprised of 77 questions targeting unique narrative events
dispersed evenly (&#x0223c;20 s) throughout the movie, was administered.
Behavioral measures indicate that subjects' memory
performance for details of the narrative that were probed was
very good (&#x0223c;68% correct). To analyze the fMRI data, we used
linear modeling and a novel analysis based on intersubject
correlation to isolate regions relevant to free viewing (Hasson
et al, 2004) and regions correlated with later memory performance.
Specifically, we created maps revealing activated voxels
that are more correlated across all of our subjects when
subjects later recall or recognize that portion of the sitcom
compared to when they do not remember it. First, we replicate
the results of Hasson et al (2004). Second, our analysis
reveals a network of brain regions in which the intersubject
correlations based on later memory outcome are distinct
from those that show correlations when memory formation
is not considered. Convergent, yet interestingly different results
were obtained using the more conventional general linear
modeling. These differences will be discussed. These data
extend traditional subsequent memory findings of differential
activity in task-relevant regions to a rich and dynamic situation
that is more ecologically valid than more traditional
experimental learning paradigms.</p><p>

idea, we compared stung to control cockroaches in two behavioral
paradigms. First, by applying electric shocks of measurable

This elevated threshold can be only partially explained
by an unspecific anesthesia since the startle (nociceptive)
response to the shock is modulated to a lesser extent.
Second, by submitting cockroaches to the forced swimming

in stung cockroaches. Yet, during swimming episodes,
stung cockroaches show normal interleg coordination, stepping
frequency range and correlation between stance duration,
discharge rate of legmuscles, and cycle frequency.However,
for a given stepping frequency, the discharge rate of leg

drug, in vitro and in vivo, with iron chelating-radical
scavenging and selective brain monoamine oxidase (MAO)-
A and B inhibitory activity. In culture studies it rescues SHSY5Y
cells from apoptotic cell death induced by serum withdrawal
and induces GAP-43 and neurite proliferation. In the
present study, its in vivo neurorescue activity has been studied
in chronic doses (0.5, 1, 2.5 mg/kg/day, 14 days) administered
orally to mice subsequently to MPTP (4 &#x000d7; 24 mg/kg).
It significantly rescued cell function of striatal dopaminergic
neurons as indicated by dopamine elevation and decrease
in the levels of its metabolites, dihydroxyphenyl acetic
acid, and homovanilic acid at all doses examined. Furthermore,
increased compensatory tyrosine-hydroxylase activity
was noted. In these regards it behaves very similarly to the established
neurogenesis activity of rasagiline, which involves
activation of tyrosine kinase receptor signaling pathway, resulting from its propargyl moiety and not MAO inhibition.
One of the limitations of MAO inhibitors as antidepressants
or anti-Parkinson's drugs is their ability to potentiate the cardiovascular
effect of tyramine, resulting from inhibition of
systemic MAO-A. M30 (5, 10 mg/kg IP) selectively inhibited
brain (striatum and hippocampus) MAO-AB by more than
85% and raised striatal levels of dopamine, noradrenaline
and serotonin, with little inhibition of liver and small intestine
enzymes. In contrast to the nonselective MAO inhibitor
tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg IP), which fully inhibits MAOAB
in the brain and systemic organs and potentiates tyramine
cardiovascular effect, M30 exhibited a limited effect. Its
tyramine potentiation limitation, the ability to raise brain
levels of aminergic neurotransmitters, and its neurorescue
activity in the MPTP model make this drug potentially an
important agent for prevention and treatment of PD and depression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5794" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IS THE OPIOID SYSTEM INVOLVED IN

to exist in insects. Opioid-like substances have a wide range
of effects, from &#x0201c;analgesia&#x0201d; and modulation of the threshold

stung by the wasp <italic>A compressa</italic>, although not paralyzed, becomes
hypokinetic and fails to initiate escape responses to
nociceptive stimuli. The venom is injected directly into the
cockroach cephalic ganglia, and its effect takes place 30 minutes
after the sting and persists for a few days. To explore the
possibility that the venom induces hypokinesia by manipulating
opioid systems, we first injected cockroaches with the
nonspecific opioid antagonist Naloxone and tested their responses
to electric shocks of different amplitudes. Naloxone
induced a minor, dose-dependant &#x0201c;analgesic&#x0201d; effect persisting
for two hours. However, escape responses were readily
initiated in these cockroaches when the nociceptive threshold
was reached. Next, we injected cockroaches with Naloxone

cockroaches injected with saline, stung cockroaches treated
with Naloxone readily initiated escape responses similar to
control cockroaches injected with Naloxone. Furthermore,
this effect disappeared after two hours, consistent with the
time course of Naloxone's effect alone. Thus, the opioid antagonist
delayed the effect of the venom on threshold for escape.

it is not widely used due the associated adverse side

is not clear. ECT stimulates the whole brain, however it is
likely that only specific brain regions are responsible for mediation
of the therapeutic effect. Our aim was to test whether
subconvulsive electrical stimulation (SCES) of the prefrontal
cortex can induce antidepressant effects and alter levels of
BDNF in reward-related brain regions. We used the chronic
mild stress (CMS) model in rats, which induces depressive
behaviors, followed by repeated (10 days) application of ECT
or SCES delivered to specific brain sites by unilateral (left
side) implantation of an electrode. Each treatment group was
compared to a sham stimulated control group. Anhedonia
(sucrose preference), exploration and home-cage locomotion
were measured after treatment. Rats were sacrificed and
punches of various brain regions were taken for BDNF evaluation
by ELISA. Both ECT and SCES of the prefrontal cortex
had therapeutic effect in some behavioral tests and induced
changes in BDNF levels. However, only ECT induced impairment
in short-term memory. These results suggest that subconvulsive
electrical stimulation is as effective as ECT without
its side effect and point to the important role of the PFC
in the pathology of depression. Finding of brain regions in
which SCES is effective in treating depressive behavior may
advance development of new therapeutic strategies such as
deep transcranial magnetic stimulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5979" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TWO DIFFERENT STRATEGIES TO ACCESS SEMANTIC KNOWLEDGE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gigi</surname><given-names>A. </given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="a137">

the first is naming test that includes 40 objects pictures; half
of them are pictured from a conventional viewpoint (usual)
and other half pictured from unconventional viewpoints
(unusual). Participants were instructed to name the object
as fast as they can. Answers and reaction times (RT; ms) were
recorded (Gigi et al [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). The second test included 20 stimuli;
each has four items with two extraordinary items, one functional
and the other is visual. Participants were instructed to
choose one extraordinary item out of the four. Answers and
RT were recorded. For each participant a semantic index was
created (according to his/her visual/functional extraordinary
selections) and each participant was noted as having either
a &#x0201c;visual&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;semantic&#x0201d; style. Accordingly, the sample was
splited into two groups: 13 semantic and 6 visual. Mean age

there was no difference in the percent of the correct answers
between groups in the naming test (usual or unusual conditions).

of religiousness and the intensity of symptoms in patients
with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). In these cases, a
similarity between religious practices (rituals) and compulsive
rituals in OCD patients was suggested (Greenberg et al
[<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). In addition, studies have found that varied aspects of
religiousness often correlate with better mental health and
lower-anxiety levels (Gigi et al [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). However, these studies
did not distinguish religious belief from religious rituals. In
the current study, we inquired healthy subjects; all were without
psychiatric or neurological diagnosis (by self report). We
used Spielberger questioner [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] to assess level of anxiety, and
a religiousness questioner that included 25 items covering
two domains of religiosity: religious belief and religious rituals.
A significant correlation was found between level of religious
faith and level of religious rituals. Nevertheless, a negative
correlation was found between level of anxiety and the
participants' strictness for Jewish religious rituals. No significant
differences were found between anxiety and religious
belief. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
separate religious belief and religious practices and to show
association between level of anxiety and religious rituals. Accordingly,
we suggest that Jewish religious rituals can reduce
anxiety levels in healthy people.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B16"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Greenberg</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Are religious compulsions religious or compulsive: a phenomenological study</article-title><source><italic>American Journal of Psychotherapy</italic></source><year>1984</year><volume>38</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>524</fpage><lpage>532</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6517170</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B17"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gigi</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Papirovitz</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Masika</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Memory functioning following terror attack and the suggested immunity power of religious faith</article-title><comment>submitted</comment></element-citation></ref><ref id="B18"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Spielberger</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Gorsuch</surname><given-names>RL</given-names></name><name><surname>Lushene</surname><given-names>RE</given-names></name></person-group><source><italic>STAI Manual</italic></source><year>1970</year><publisher-loc>San Francisco, Calif</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Consulting Psychologists Press</publisher-name></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6219" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>REGIONALLY SPECIFIC ADAPTATION DYNAMICS IN

activity to a repeatedly presented image, has been
observed in high-level object areas, and serves as a tool to
reveal traits of underlying neuronal populations. Here we
tested the dynamics of fMR-A, and investigated whether
they are determined by cortical region, or depend on the
type of stimuli being viewed. Nine healthy subjects underwent
fMRI scans (GE 1.5T), while viewing a single grayscale
image (either face or house) for 21 s followed by a fixation
period of 21 s. Subjects were engaged in a demanding
attentional task, reporting minute contrast changes in the
stimuli that rarely occurred. Category-selective regions and
retinotopic borders were defined separately. Our results show
a clear differentiation in adaptation dynamics within the
ventral stream. Face-selective regions, both ventrally (FFA)
and more dorsally (OFA) showed a moderate initial adaptation
effect followed by a sustained level of activity for
both face and house images. In contrast, the house-related
CoS region showed a rapid initial decline followed by sustained
activity for houses, while dropping essentially to baseline
for faces. The object-related LO exhibited slower continuous
adaptation decline throughout the block for both
categories. Interestingly, within the regions, the decline of
the signal from the peak activation did not depend on the
viewed category (preferred or nonpreferred). Thus, our results
demonstrate that the functional differentiation in ventral
stream regions is evident not only in their functional
selectivity but also in their adaptation dynamics. Since the
more peripherally-biased, house-related CoS region showed
a sharp clear-cut drop in its activity levels, compared to
the more foveally-biased face- and object-related regions,
we would like to propose that the neuronal computational
mechanisms within object-selective cortex are driven by
center-periphery organization, and not by category-specific
features.</p><p>

noncholinergic. In the present study, the changes in mRNA
levels of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), choline acetyltrasnsferase
(ChAT), glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) 65 and
67, bax and bcl-2 were measured in rat hippocampus and
cortex, 2 hours and 24 hours post sarin exposure, using
RT-PCR. The effects of antidotal treatments including
TMB-4 and atropine (TA) 1min post sarin, alone or with
the addition of immediate (1 min post sarin) or delayed
(15min post sarin) midazolam were evaluated as well. Two
hours following sarin, the hippocampal mRNA levels of all
the genes, except for GAD67, were reduced in convulsive
untreated animals. At 24 hours post exposure, elevations
of hippocampal mRNA levels of ChAT, GAD67, and bax, increments of cortical mRNA levels of GAD65, GAD67, and
bax, together with significant loss of body weight and poor
physical conditions, were observed in the untreated rats.
Similar results were obtained in rats treated with TA alone.
When immediate midazolam was added, mRNA levels and
clinical conditions were as in na&#x000ef;ve animals. However, if midazolam
was delayed, mRNA levels and clinical conditions
varied. These findings imply that in the hippocampus, 24
hours post sarin exposure, there are requirements for acetylcholine
(ACh) and gama-butyric acid (GABA) synthesis,
and possible cell death process, reflected by the elevation in
mRNA levels of ChAT, GAD67, and bax, respectively. Similar
indications for ACh and GABA requirements were obtained
when inadequate treatment, TA alone, was used. GABA deficiency
and cell death process were indicated in cortex at 24

these findings may lead to the development of novel therapeutic

impairment in the newborn, with life span motor

hypoxia (H) we have shown thatMg partially prevents
damage to the Purkinje cells and the granular layer in the
cerebellum. In the current study we apply gene chipmethodology
in order to identify genes affected by maternal H and
Mg. This was tested in the cerebellum of mice fetus (embryonic
day 17), 2 hours after H. Gene expression was analyzed
using Affymetrix Gene Chips (mo 430 2.0). Comparison of
gene expression in the control group (saline treated followed
by exposure to atmosphere air) to H group (saline, followed
by 2 hours exposure to 9% oxygen and 3% CO2) revealed
that the expression of 124 genes was modified (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01). H
induced upregulation of 40 genes and downregulation of 84
genes. Maternal pretreatment with Mg (4 hours, followed by
2 hours H) altered the expression of 103 genes compared to
the control (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01). Of these genes, 75 were upregulated
and 28 downregulated. Only 15 similar genes were modified
in these two comparisons, indicating that Mg prevented the
majority of changes stimulated by H but on the other hand
induced robust alteration in other genes. Two genes involved
in neuron proliferation and migration were further tested.
A significant increase in the levels of 14-3-3e protein was observed
in the cerebellum 2 hours after H, with or without Mg
pretreatment (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .01). In the hippocampus, H and MgH
increased the expression of 14-3-3e mRNA (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05), however,
this was not translated to changes in 14-3-3e protein. In
addition, an increase was observed in CDC42 protein in the
cerebellum following H (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05) and was prevented by Mg.
In the hippocampus a tendency of decrease in CDC42 was
induced by H. Overall, H and Mg modify a different set of

for such global organizational principles, we applied the

to fMRI data collected from several different experiments.
The experiments included continuous audio-visual movie,
a block-design visual experiment, an experiment involving
internal mental tasks in the absence of input/output, and
a rest-state scan. The analysis was performed on the entire
cortical space and was limited to two-class subdivision. Our
results show that the entire cerebral cortex is naturally partitioned
into two global systems. Importantly, this fundamental
divide was highly consistent anatomically across different
subjects. This clustering-based division of the cortex
into a bipartite organization is in a good agreement with our
previous study which was based on different methods and
paradigm. In that study we suggested that the human posterior
cortex can be divided into two global systems: one dealing
with the external environement&#x02014;the &#x0201c;extrinsic&#x0201d; system,
and one dealing with internal&#x02014;endogenous information&#x02014;

was shown to be deactivated by task-oriented paradigms by

patterns, such as a prolonged delay followed by highfrequency

patterns are generated by an interplay between a slowlyinactivating
d-type potassium current and the window current
of the sodium current, namely the overlap between the
activation and inactivation curves of this current. To test
this hypothesis, we construct a minimal, conductance-based
model of FS cells and investigate its behavior using the fastslow
technique and bifurcation theory. When the sodium
window current is small, the model neuron fires at a relatively
high rate following the delay, the subthreshold voltage varies
almost linearly during firing periods, the delay duration depends
strongly on noise, and noisy subthreshold oscillations
appear. The neuron may stutter if the conductance of the
d-current is strong enough. When the sodium window current
is large, the neuron may fire at low rates, the subthreshold
voltage during firing shows inflection points, there are
no subthreshold oscillations and no stuttering, and the delay
duration is almost noise-independent. Intracellular recording
reveal examples for the two classes of firing patterns. We
conclude that biological heterogeneity in the properties of
ionic channels, together with dynamical system properties,
can account for the distinct firing patterns FS interneurons

disorder caused by an expansion of a poly-Q
tract in the huntingtin (Htt) protein. In an attempt to reveal
Htt function, several studies have tried to identify interacting
proteins. One of these is the Htt-interacting protein
1 (HIP1). So far it has been shown that HIP1 is related to
the process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), however,
the precise step in which it participates and its exact
role are still a debate. CME is important formany central cell
functions, and in neurons it has a central role in recycling
of synaptic vesicles after stimulation. We study the involvement
of HIP1 and the contribution of its interaction with
clathrin in endocytosis. We show that the central fragment
of HIP1 (HIP1(218&#x02013;604)) is mislocalized and creates big cellular
structures that contain clathrin, AP2, and EEA1. These
structures are comprised from smaller units that attach and
detach from each other dynamically. In addition, we found
some HIP1(218&#x02013;604) in smaller clusters close to the plasma
membrane. To learn about the involvement of HIP1 in early
steps of CME, we followed the dynamics of fluorescently
tagged clathrin and/or HIP1 or HIP1(218&#x02013;604), using total
internal reflection fluorescent microscopy (TIRFM). Our
preliminary results demonstrate that the full length HIP1
particles stay close to the plasma membrane for longer times
than clathrin and are less mobile. However, HIP1(218&#x02013;604)
clusters behave in a way that resembles clathrin clusters, implying
it lost its functionality in this step. Simultaneous expression
of both clathrin and HIP1(218&#x02013;604) shows mostly
overlapping patterns both in the plasma membrane and in
inner parts of the cell. In addition, we examined HIP1's effect
on synaptic vesicles recycling using styryl dyes uptake assays
in hippocampal neurons. We show that overexpression
of HIP1 enhances styryl dyes uptake to the synapse, while
vesicles pools remain unchanged.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6601" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NAP: NEUROPROTECTION BY REDUCTION OF TAU

from activity-dependent neuroprotective protein (ADNP), a
protein essential for brain formation (Bassan et al [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Gozes
et al [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]; Pinhasov et al [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Original studies have shown that
ADNP (Furman et al [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]) decorate microtubules. Further
studies showed that NAP stimulates microtubule assembly
and reduces tau hyperphosphorylation in astrocytes in culture
(Gozes &#x00026; Divinski [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]; Divinski et al [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Divinski et al
[<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]). It is hypothesized that NAP acts, in large part, through
a reduction in tau phosphorylation with resultant effects on
microtubule stabilization. This is supported by a number
of studies. In vivo studies showed that in ADNP-deficient
mice there is tau hyperphosphorylation that can be decreased
by chronic NAP treatment. In models of neurodegenerative
diseases such as experimental encephalomyelitis, NAP
treatment reduced tau hyperphosphorylation in the brain.
In a model of tauopathy (triple transgenic mice expressing
an Alzheimer's disease like phenotype), NAP reduced tau
hyperphosphorylation. Part of the NAP effect may be also associated with altered regulation of the kinases that control
tau hyperphosphorylation. The functional outcome of the
increased hyperphosphorylation of tau is diminished cognitive
functions in the case of ADNP deficiency, which in parallel
studies was ameliorated by NAP treatment. In the case of
EAE, the functional outcome is paralysis, which was ameliorated
in part by NAP treatment. Based on these preclinical
findings, Allon Therapeutics Inc, a Vancouver-based company,
is conducting phase II clinical trials on NAP as a potential
neuroprotective drug candidate.</p><p>

across many trials or events. Hence, these techniques
fail to consider trial-by-trial variability. The objective of this
study is to examine dynamic features of neural activity as it
evolves within a single trial, while taking into consideration
the variability between trials. Thus, we asked the following
questions on a single trial basis: are the activities in early
and late epochs of a trial correlated? How does the activity in
different epochs of a trial correlate with behavioral parameters?
To address these questions we recorded, simultaneously,
single unit activity, using 32 independently moveable microelectrodes
from primary motor (M1) and premotor areas of
the monkey during performance of behavioral tasks. The basic
task consists of a &#x0201c;center-out&#x0201d; reaching movement performed
in a horizontal plane. The analysis reveals signs for
correlated activity in different epochs of the trial. For example,
activity before the onset of a directional cue (pre-cue)
could be correlated with later epochs, after the cue is presented
(post-cue). We also found that the degree of correlation
changes at different time windows. Furthermore, preliminary
analyses suggest that firing rate in the pre-cue interval
may be correlated with behavioral parameters (eg, reaction
time (RT)). These correlatesmay improve the prediction
of behavior on the basis of neural activity in a single trial as
well as explain the behavioral variability.</p><p>

and their activity are at the essence of neuronal transmission.
The most accurate method, so far, for determining ionchannel
kinetic mechanisms is single-channel recording and
analysis. Nevertheless, single-channel recordings carry several
holdups and complexities, especially when dealing with
voltage-gated channels. Here we show that genetic search algorithms
(GAs) can be used to fit whole-cell voltage-clamp
data to kineticmodels with a high degree of accuracy. The approach
takes into consideration the full range of stimulation
protocols used when analyzing voltage-gated ion channels.
Unlike most previous analyses done, protocols' results were
not analyzed individually, but rather as an entire set of traces
from all protocols for a simultaneous analysis. The algorithm
was initially tested over simulated current traces produced
using several simpleHodgkin-Huxley-like models of voltagegated
potassium and sodium channels. Currents were also
produced simulating levels of noise expected from actual
patch recordings. Finally, the algorithm was used for finding
the kinetic parameters of several voltage-gated sodium and
potassium channels models via matching its results to data
recorded, in nucleated configuration, from layer 5 pyramidal
neurons of the rat cortex. Theminimization scheme provides
a tool for electrophysiologists in mimicking and simulating
voltage-gated ion-channel kinetics on the cellular level.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7103" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>3D MAP OF WHISKER REPRESENTATIONS IN

nucleus (VPM) is occupied by vibrissal representations
known as barreloids. In coronal sections stained for cytochrome
oxidase (CO), VPM appears as a homologous
structure. However, double-labeling experiments revealed
that barreloids are divided into dorsomedial (dm, core) and
ventrolateral (vl, tail) compartments (Pierret et al [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Recently,
we have shown that (1) the extent of VPMdmand VPMvl
can be determined by cutting the brain at specific angles,
and staining for CO (Haidarliu and Ahissar [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]); (2) neuronal
populations of the two compartments of the VPM convey
different electrophysiological information during whisking
and object touch (Yu et al [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]). Because of such functional
segregation, these two compartments can be considered
as different sub-nuclei, and their stereotaxic identification
in standard sectioning planes becomes important. Here,
we apply a method for coordinate transformation based on
morphological normalization to convert oblique to coronal
coordinates. Using this method we determined the border
between VPMdm and VPMvl in serial coronal sections, and
created a compartmentalized tree-dimensional model of the
VPM. Most of the rostral part of the VPM (&#x0223c;40%) belongs
to VPMdm and contains the rows E and D. In more caudal
sections, VPMvl becomes gradually more dominant and occupies
between 20% to 60% of the medio-lateral extent of the
VPM. The most caudal coronal slice of the VPM belongs to
VPMvl containing rows A and B. We suggest that the coronal
coordinates of the VPMdm/VPMvl border will be added to
standard atlas descriptions of the rat thalamus.</p><p>

K+ channels. KCNQ1 alpha subunits coassemble with
calmodulin and KCNE1 beta subunits to generate the Iks
potassium current, which is critical for normal repolarization
of the cardiac action potential. Mutations in either
KCNQ1 or KCNE1 genes produce the long QT syndrome, a
life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia. To study both static
proximity and voltage-dependent molecular rearrangements
of the Iks channel complex, KCNQ1, KCNE1, and calmodulin
were C-terminally fused with enhanced cyan fluorescent
protein and/or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein and expressed
in Xenopus oocytes. Using the spectral analysis of
a Zeiss 510 Meta confocal microscope, we studied the fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) simultaneously
combined with two-electrode voltage-clamp recording of K+
currents. At &#x02013;80 mV, a holding potential where no K+ currents
flow through the closed Iks channel, a strong constitutive
FRET signal was observed suggesting that a distance
of less than 10 nM exists between the fluorescently tagged Ctermini
of KCNQ1 and KCNE1 in the closed channel conformation.
A marked voltage-dependent, FRET signal change
was recorded at +30 mV concomitantly with Iks K+ currents,
suggesting spatial rearrangement of the KCNQ1 and
KCNE1 subunits during the gating process. No FRET signal
was observed when 1 : 1 molar ratio of C-terminally
tagged KCNQ1-CFP and KCNQ1-YFP was coexpressed despite
the simultaneous record of K+ currents, suggesting at
least 10 nM spacing in the C-termini of KCNQ1 alpha subunits
(adjacent or diagonally facing) or an inappropriate angle
of fluorophore polarization for energy transfer. We currently
analyze the spatial organization of the Iks complex
during the gating process and examine the impact of LQT
mutants on these voltage-dependent molecular rearrangements.</p><p>

the mid-hindbrain border, whereas noradrenergic (NA) and
serotonergic neurons develop juxtaposed in the hindbrain.
The junction between the developing mid and hindbrain
harbors cells secreting signals that direct the development of
the brain stem, and is hence termed the mid-hindbrain organizer
(MHO). The transcription factor Otx2 is expressed
in the midbrain and plays a central role in positioning the
MHO, defining midbrain patterning and cell fates. In an earlier
study, we demonstrated that the position of the MHO
determines the location and size of dopaminergic and serotonergic
cell populations. In contrast, the development of adjacent
cranial nerve nuclei is not influenced by the position of the MHO. Here, we use mouse mutants with a caudally
shiftedMHO(En1+/Otx2) to investigate the influence of this
organizer on the development of the locus coeruleus, the major
NA nucleus. We report that the locus coeruleus develops
close to the MHO and is reduced in En1+/Otx2 mutants.
Surprisingly, we found that there is a substantial overlap
between the ectopically expressed Otx2 and NA marker.
This was unexpected since Otx2 was shown in other experiments
to be sufficient to induce midbrain cell fate identity.
Based on loss of function experiments, Fgf8 is known to be
required for the development of NA neurons. However, the
interpretation of these results is hampered by the fact that
cell survival in the entire rostral hindbrain depends on Fgf8.
Therefore, we tested whether the decreased NA cell population
in En1+/Otx2 mutants is associated with an altered Fgf8
expression. Interestingly, we found that the Fgf8 domain is
in fact enlarged; suggesting that the decrease in the NA cell
population is not likely to be mediated through this secreted
molecule. Currently we are investigating the possibility that
the MHO affects NA neurons via Bmps.</p><p>

et al [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]), human participants learned new categories
from either PECs or NECs. It was found that most participants
learned new categories quite well when provided with
only PECs while many failed in properly using NECs, even
when the provided constraints contained all the information
needed for performing the experimental task correctly. This
difference in the use of PECs versus NECs may be explained
by the ecological observation, that NECs are rarely informative
in everyday life while all PECs are informative. This disadvantage
of NECs may explain the unavailability of inherent,
or early-learned, strategy for properly using even informative
NECs. In order to further investigate this hypothesis,
we compared the performance of adults and young children
when using PECs and NECs. If strategies for using PECs are
indeed inherent or acquired early in life, while strategies for
using NECs are only sometimes acquired at a latter stage of
development, then we expect to see that young children will
be able to successfully use PECs as often as adults, but will
only rarely use NECs as well as adults.</p><p>

and prefrontal cortices, the parietal lobes have not usually
been assigned a specific role in long-term declarative memory.
However, several recent fMRI studies have reported robust
bilateral (left &#x0003e; right) activation in lateral posterior parietal
cortex and the precuneus during the retrieval stages of
recognition memory tasks. It has not yet been determined
what cognitive processes are represented by these activations.
In order to examine whether parietal lobe-based processes
are necessary for basic episodic recognition abilities,
we tested a group of first-incident CVA patients whose cortical
damage included (but was not limited to) unilateral
(RH or LH) posterior parietal lesions. These patients performed
a series of tasks, similar to those yielding parietal
activations in fMRI studies: yes/no recognition judgments
on visual words, and on colored object pictures and identifiable
environMental sounds. The extant of each patient's
damage was measured, and percentage of lesion in parietal
(and other) structures was determined using a lesion analysis
tool (ABLe). Then, correlations were performed between lesion
size in ROIs and performance. In addition, voxel-based
lesion symptommapping (VLSM) analysis was applied to the
whole brain in order to reveal lesion sites that affect behavior.
Patients with LH lesions were not impaired at any of the tasks
compared to a matched control group. Patients with RH lesions
were not impaired in memory for visual words, but
were impaired in recognition of object pictures, and had significantly
higher false alarm rate in sound recognition. Correlations
and VLSM analysis did not reveal significant parietal
contribution to behavioral impairments, and imply that
these impairments result from perceptual and monitoring
problems caused by their damage outside the parietal lobes.
This suggests that parietal activations reported in fMRI studies
reflect peri-retrieval processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7495" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HYPOMETHYLATION CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO

is associated with developmental delay and behavior
disorders ranging from reduced learning abilities to autistic
features. In newborn rats, prenatal exposure to the AED valproate
(VPA) was shown to induce autistic-like features. We
have recently reported developmental delay and hypoactivity
in adult mice following perinatal exposure to daily application
of vigabatrin (GVG) during P4&#x02013;P14. Compared to
control mice behavior in the open field arena, GVG treated
mice showed hyperactivity, at P14; a longer distance moved
(383 versus 160 cm), and increased velocity (1.29 versus
0.53 cm/s; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05, <italic>n</italic> = 10). This behavior switched to hypoactivity
in GVG treated mice examined at adulthood: distance
moved is 1243 versus 1647 cm, velocity is 3.34 versus
4.87 cm/s (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05, <italic>n</italic> = 10). Repeated, weekly examination
abolished the difference in all parameters between
GVG and control mice, suggesting that the hyper/hypoactivities
are not due to motor deficiency. We suggest that
VPA and GVG may modify the developmental program by
active DNA demethylation. We used a model system of HEK
cells transfected with methylated CMV-GFP plasmid. Plasmid
was methylated in vitro by SssI CpG methyltransferase
in a buffer containing S-adenosylmethionine (SAM). Complete
methylation of the plasmid was confirmed by observing
full protection from HpaII digestion. Transfected cells
were treated with VPA and GVG for 48 hours. DNA was
extracted and plasmid methylation was tested by protection
from HpaII digestion and Southern blot analysis. VPA
(20 mM) induced partial demethylation of plasmid DNA,
whereas GVG (0.05, 0.1 mM) did not induce demethylation
of the plasmid. Our results partially support possible involvement
of DNA demethylation caused by AEDs as an epigenetic
mechanism affecting development. However, different
drugs may act through different mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7568" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>VISUAL TASK PERFORMANCE AFFECTS THE AUDITORY

manner, remaining resources enable a constant scan of our
environ Ment for potentially important deviant events. Detection
of deviation may trigger in turn attention reallocation.
In addition, this process is reflected in the mismatch
negativity (MMN) event-related potential (ERP). A fundamental
debate regards the extent to which this signal, generally
considered to be &#x0201c;automatic,&#x0201d; is susceptible to attentional
load. Previously, we found that the MMN is robust
and its magnitude is only slightly decreased despite heavy
visual attentional load [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. However, in that study even the
baseline condition was quite demanding, so a floor effect
could not be excluded. In the current study, we increased
the load difference between the two conditions. In an &#x0201c;attentional
blink&#x0201d; paradigm, participants identified two visual
targets within a rapid visual stream, while ignoring background
test-signal tones of standard pitch, mixed with infrequent
pitch deviants. Load was manipulated mainly by
changing the contrast level of the visual stream and the contrast
ratio between the targets and distractors. Subtracting
the ERP of the standard from that of the deviant sounds
elicited the MMN signal. Only mismatch responses for stimuli
appearing before the visual targets were analyzed. Task
performance decreased significantly with increasing load.
Whereas the MMN remained robust with both loads, its amplitude
was significantly decreased for the high load condition
compared to the low load condition and its latency
was significantly shorter. Moreover, in the high load condition,
MMN peak amplitude and latency was conspicuously
smaller in amplitude in correct trials compared to incorrect
trials, reflecting the transient attentional state of the participant.
These findings suggest that the auditory change detection
process is disturbed by perceptual load and attentional
factors.</p><p>

into the head ganglia of its prey the cockroach to induce
hypokinesia that lasts for several days. This hypokinesia is
characterized by a decrease in spontaneous walking and by
the inability to escape. We hypothesize that the venom injection
reduces or abolishes the activity of neurons in the
head ganglia and that these neurons regulate the excitability
of thoracic motor circuits. To test this hypothesis, we performed
the following two experiments. First, we performed
extra cellular recordings from one neck connective, which
contains descending axons fromneurons in the head ganglia. The descending activity in stung animals was decreased by
64% compared to that of control. Such a decrease could indicate
a reduction in excitatory drive from the head ganglia
to the thoracic motor circuitries. If this is correct, then, artificially
decreasing the activity from head ganglia should induce
motor impairments similar to those observed in stung
animals. To test this, we used procaine, a reversible blocker
of voltage-dependant Na+ channel. First, using extra cellular
recording we verified that 100 nL of 50% procaine injected
into the cockroach CNS is sufficient to block all neuronal
activity for at least one hour. Using behavioral tests,
we found that during the effective period of procaine, cockroaches
injected into the brain spontaneously walked significantly
more than controls. In contrast cockroaches injected
into the SEG did not spontaneously walk at all and were
unable to escape. Then, the later behaved like stung cockroaches.
All cockroaches recovered 2 hours after the injection
and their behavior did not differ from that of controls. These
results indicate that the injection of procaine only in the SEG
mimics the effect of venom injection by the wasp. Thus, this
also suggests that it is the SEG, rather than the brain, which
has a more significant role in venom induced hypokinesia.</p><p>

the establishment of correspondence between matching features
in the two retinal images. The brain seems to solve this
correspondence problem easily, best demonstrated by the
vivid sense of stereoscopic depth that we get from randomdot
stereograms, but efforts to understand how the brain
achieves this feat have shown the problem to be surprisingly
difficult. We analyze the binocular correspondence problem
assuming that the goal of stereoscopic vision is not depth
perse, but, rather, the construction of rigid continuous surfaces.
Using this assumption we assign to every point in every
retinal projection a small neighborhood in its vicinity. If the
neighborhood is small enough, it can serve as an approximation
to the projection of a tangent plane to the 3D surface
that stereopsis tries to construct. Since the two eyes view the
same surface, tangent planes in corresponding points should
be similar. Therefore every point can use its neighborhood
as a signature and try to find a similar signature in the other
retinal projection, presumably belonging to the sought for
corresponding point. The hard part is deciding what qualifies
as &#x0201c;similar.&#x0201d; We do this through the analysis of constraints
imposed by 3D surfaces and the disparity gradient
limit on binocular fusion. This allows the algorithm to go beyond
simple cross-correlation schemes that have been used
before. The idea was implemented and tested on randomdot
stereograms and natural images (preprocessed with V1-
like orientation-selective filters) with good results. We argue
that our approach can explain the puzzling existence of two
noncongruent ideas on the limit of binocular fusion, namely,
Panum's fusional areas and the disparity gradient limit for fusion,
and also offers a synthesis of the two. Lastly, we suggest
that the motion correspondence problem, in optic flow or in
constructing structure from motion, could be solved along
similar lines.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7707" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ZINC ACTS VIA A SPECIFIC ZINC-SENSING RECEPTOR,

cells, that is particularly versatile and dynamic in the brain.
During embryogenesis zinc is essential for proper brain
growth and development. Indeed zinc deficiency postnatally,
among other symptoms, leads to the onset of seizures. During
neuronal activity there is a remarkable rise in free zinc
released from glutamatergic nerve terminals. These steep
changes in brain zinc are suggested to play a key physiological
role in synaptic transmission, and are also a leading factor
in neuronal death following ischemia and epilepsy. We
have identified an extracellular zinc sensing receptor, ZnR,
in the brain. This is a G-protein-coupled receptor that mediates
intracellular calcium release in the brain via the IP3
pathway. Our results suggest that the ZnR is found on the
pyramidal post-synaptic neurons in the CA3-hippocampal
region. ZnR activity was induced by synaptically released
zinc and was attenuated in the presence of the extracellular
zinc chelator, CaEDTA. Furthermore, knockout mice lacking
synaptic zinc (ZnT-3 KO) show a significant reduction in
the ZnR activity following synaptic release. Finally, activity
of the ZnR regulates the K+/Cl&#x02212; cotransporter (KCC), and
thereby may modulate the cellular Cl&#x02212; gradients. We therefore
suggest that the ZnR is the link between synaptically released
zinc and the zinc-dependent effects on cell signaling
and ion transport in post synaptic cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7736" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LEARNING BYWATCHING: DOES EXPERTISE

beings is their ability to learn sophisticated motor tasks through observation of others performing the same task.
This ability has been documented repeatedly in the recent
literature, and imaging studies are now unraveling the complex
network we use when we watch others performing motor
tasks. One hypothesis that has been proposed on the basis
of this growing literature is that action observation activates
our motor system in much the same way that actual practice
does. This would suggest that learning from observation is,
at root, a very similar process to learning through practice.
We sought to test this hypothesis by examining the how action
observation interacts with expertise in the task being observed.
Human subjects practiced one of two motor tasks&#x02014;
reduced juggling or devil stick dribbling&#x02014;for thirty minutes
each day over the course of three days. On each day, their
practice was interrupted twice with an observation session.
Each observation session lasted ten minutes. In the observation
session, subjects either watched the task they were practicing
(&#x0201c;same observation&#x0201d;) or the other task (&#x0201c;different observation&#x0201d;).
We find a significant interaction between the day
of observation and the difference in performance between
the groups. Post hoc testing showed that, when compared to
the different observation group, the same observation group
performed better on the second and third day but not on
the first. We interpret this finding to mean that a certain familiarity
with the task is necessary in order to improve from
action observation. We made a further effort to understand
these results by comparing improvement from one training
set to the next when the two sets were separated by an observation
period and when they were not separated by an observation
set. However, in this analysis we did not find any significant
differences between the rate of improvement in the
two sets.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7783" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EXPOSING RATS TO JUVENILE STRESS AFFECTS BODY

<italic>Background</italic>. Epidemiological studies indicate that childhood
trauma is predominantly associated with higher rates of both
mood and anxiety disorders, which were associated with altered
limbic system functioning. Exposing rats to stress during
juvenility (27&#x02013;29 days of age) has comparable effects
and was suggested as a model of induced predisposition
for these disorders (Avital and Richter-Levin, 2005; Tsoory
and Richter-Levin, 2005; Tsoory et al, 2006). <italic>Objectives</italic>. The
current study utilized the juvenile stress model and examined
its effects on body weight and exploratory behaviors
in the open field test both soon after the exposure and in
adulthood. <italic>Results</italic>. Juvenile stressed rats exhibited less body
weight gain than control (unexposed) rats soon after the exposure
(34 days of age). However, these differences were not
evident in adulthood (62 days of age). In comparison with
controls, juvenile stressed rats explored the open field more
when tested 1hr following the juvenile stress protocol, however,
this was not evident at the age of 34 days. Moreover,
when tested in adulthood juvenile stressed rats exhibited less
exploratory behavior than controls. A similar pattern of results
was found also for the anxiety index of time spent in
the center of the open field. Compared with controls, juvenile
stressed rats spent more time in the center of the open
field when tested 1hr after the juvenile stress protocol, however,
this was not evident at the age of 34 days. Moreover,
when tested in adulthood juvenile stressed rats spent less
time in the center of the open field than controls.<italic>Conclusions</italic>.
Taken together with previous findings the data suggests
that exposure to juvenile stress interacts with maturation
processes and may imply alterations in the development
of the limbic system, which may underlie the predisposition
to exhibitmood and/or anxiety disorders symptoms in
adulthood.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7830" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>BAYESIAN-LIKE INFERENCE UNDERLIES

This hypothesis predicts that the larger the uncertainty in
the memory is the more pronounced the contraction bias

constructed a visual memory discrimination task in which
subjects were instructed to memorize for several seconds the
length of a bar presented on a computer screen, and report
its length by comparing it to the length of a reference bar.
Analyzing the performance of subjects in this task we show
that subjects tend to overestimate large magnitudes and underestimate
small magnitudes, in agreement with contraction
bias. In order to control the uncertainty in the length
of the memorized bar, we added a distracting task to some of
the trials. As expected from our hypothesis, the contraction
bias in the trials with the distractor was significantly larger

<italic>Background</italic>. Mutations in DJ-1 were discovered recently to
cause early onset Parkinson's disease. Accumulating data indicate
that DJ-1 plays an important role in oxidative stress,
and is involved in various neurodegenerative diseases. Oxidative
stress has a central role in the pathogenesis of multiple
sclerosis (MS). <italic>Aim</italic>. To examine whether there are changes in
DJ-1 expression in an animal model of MS, experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE). <italic>Methods</italic>. Chronic EAE
was induced in 30 mice that were sacrificed at different disease
severities. U-87 human glioma cells exposed to oxidative
stress induced by SIN-I were used as an in vitro model. DJ-1
mRNA and protein levels were quantified by real-time PCR
and Western blotting, respectively. Changes in DJ-1 isoelectric
point were evaluated by isoelectric focusing. MTT and
DCF assays were used to quantify viability and intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS), respectively. Results. We
found upregulation of DJ-1 mRNA and protein expression
levels in EAE and a correlation between disease severity and
increased DJ-1 levels. While DJ-1 isoforms were more alkaline
in controls, in EAE there was a shift towards acidic isoforms.
ROS induced by SIN-I exposure led to an increase in
DJ-1 mRNA and protein levels in human glioma cells. <italic>Conclusions</italic>.
This is the first report of modulation of DJ-1 expression
in EAE. Upregulation of DJ-1 was noted in EAE, and
similar results were observed in glioma cells exposed to ROS.
Monitoring DJ-1 levels and oxidized isoforms may serve as a
biomarker for evaluation of disease activity and therapeutic
response. In view of the accumulating evidence on the central
role of oxidative stress in MS, and the importance of DJ-1
in oxidative stress management by the CNS, we believe that
DJ-1 will be found to have a central role in MS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7934" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DOWNREGULATION OF T AND B CELL FUNCTION BY

found in fetal and maternal fluids during pregnancy. Clinical
remissions during pregnancy have been observed in several
autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis (MS)
and have been attributed to the presence of pregnancyassociated
natural immune-reactive substances, including
AFP which can exert immunomodulatory effects on immune
cells. In this study, we tested the effect of recombinant human
AFP (rhAFP) isolated from transgenic goats, which
contain the genomic DNA for hAFP, on the autoimmuneinflammatory
process in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis
(EAE), a T cell mediated disease that serves
as an animal model for MS. RhAFP treatment markedly improved
the clinical manifestations of EAE, preventing central
nervous system inflammation and axonal degeneration.
RhAFP exerted a broad immunomodulating activity, influencing
the various populations of immune cells. Activated T
cells derived from treated mice had significantly reduced activity
towards the encephalitogenic peptide of myelin oligodendrocyte
glycoprotein (MOG), exhibiting less proliferation
and reduced Th1 cytokine secretion. Moreover, passive
transfer of those T cells into na&#x000ef;ve nice resulted in modified
clinical disease. In addition, AFP affected the humoral
response, causing an inhibition in MOG-specific antibody
production. The expression of CD11b, MHC class II and the
chemokine receptor CCR5 were also downregulated. The exact
mechanism of action is not clear but our results indicate
that it affects antigen presentation, signal transduction pathways
associated with inflammatory response and apoptosis
signaling. In light of our findings, rhAFP may serve as a potential
candidate for treatment of MS and other autoimmune
diseases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8006" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEURAL CORRELATES OF OBJECTS INDETERMINACY IN

representational paintings evoked stronger activation than indeterminate paintings in the temporoparietal junction, a

the frequency of sampling each card belonging to a set, and
the &#x0201c;sequential distance&#x0201d; between the 3 cards of the set, comparing
fixations of the identified set to those which were not
identified. We found that generally the cards of the sets that
were ultimately found were among the most observed cards,
that is, the total time of fixations was longer for the found (reported)
set compared to the unfound sets present at the same

more intense observation of certain cards leading to finding
within them a set, or alternatively, a sense that among certain
cards there is a set, leading to observation of these cards, and

and one of the most prevalent neurological disorders
affecting 0.5%&#x02013;5% of the population. ET is characterised by
episodic muscle tremor at around 10 Hz, amplified during
movement. Harmaline-induced tremor is one of the classical
animal models for ET, exhibiting similar characteristics
and similar drug relief, and is known to involve the inferior
olive. The olivary hypothesis proposes that harmalineinduced
tremor results from a direct effect of harmaline on
T-type calcium currents in olivary neurons, increasing their
tendency to oscillate. However, it is yet unclear if and how
this neuronalmechanism underlies the episodic nature of essential
tremor. To resolve this question, we recorded neuronal
activity in the cerebellar cortex of freely moving rats using
chronically implanted microelectrode arrays before and after
harmaline injection (15mg/kg, Ip). After harmaline application,
6 Hz&#x02013;10 Hz rhythmicity appeared in the multiunit
activity, reflecting olivary input through the climbing
fibres. The rats exhibited strong, episodic tremor in the same
frequency range, as recorded by EMG electrodes implanted
in the limbs. We hypothesized that tremor episodes result
from the phase-locking of continuously oscillating olivary
units. To study the phase coupling across the different channels,
we extracted the amplitude envelopes of the multiunit
channels, and studied the frequency band elevated after
harmaline application (usually in the 7.5 Hz&#x02013;15 Hz range).
We developed a measure of population phase-locking of the
recorded units, and showed that after harmaline application,
episodes of phase-locking, lasting up to several seconds, occur
much more often than expected assuming independent
oscillations. We propose that these phase-locking epochs may
underlie the epochs of elevated tremor.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8162" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>JUVENILE STRESS-INDUCED ALTERATION OF GABAA

The GABAARs are best distinguished by their type of alpha

Following the behavioral assessment, we quantitatively determined
the level of expression of alpha1, 2, and 3 in the

of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the central
nervous system (CNS) resulting in dementia. The current
research proposed to evaluate tau-related pathology in
a mouse model overexpressing the shortest human brain tau
isoform in the CNS. Tau-transgenics and wt control group
were tested at 7 months of age. This age was previously characterized
as exhibiting a peak of molecular neuropathology
in these transgenic mice. Here, animal behavioral pathology
was evaluated by cognitive, motor, and emotional tests. Our
results suggested that these tau-transgenic mice had significantly
higher weights as compared to their wt littermates.
Comparative analyses of emotional performance, using the
open field test (OFT) and the elevated-plus maze (EPM),
demonstrated that the tau-transgenic mice exhibited higher
explorative behavior and were also less anxious than the controls.
The OFT and the EPM also suggested higher motor activity
in the tau-transgenic mice. It was previously assumed,
however, that these tests could be influenced by the emotional
status of the animal. Nonspatial learning abilities were
analyzed by the passive avoidance test. This test is known
to assess learning and memory of emotional events such as
an electric shock. The test results demonstrated successive
learning in the tau-transgenic mice, but not in their wt counterparts.
In order to estimate whether such reduced anxiety,
increased motor functions and learning ability in the
tau-transgenic animals are correlated with brain pathology,
8-month-old animals from each group were sacrificed and
their brains and spinal cords are going to be analyzed in further
biochemical and immunohistochemical analyses. This
preliminary data suggests that tau over expression may result
in increased cognitive function in 7-month-old mice. Ongoing
characterization of potential tau hyperphosphorylation
will be important to the interpretation of the data.</p><p>

Many factors identified as contributing to this variability. In
the current part of the study we aimed to characterize the
evolution of brain activation in stroke patients with variable
degree of motor status and motor recovery. Nine stroke
patients underwent motor 7 function testing and fMRI in
the acute/subacute and chronic phases following ischemic
stroke. Brain activation was mapped during passive movement
of the paretic hand. The patients were divided into
three subgroups according to the motor performance in the
acute phase and degree of motor recovery. Different patterns
of reorganization were identified. In the group of good motor
status and good motor recovery, upregulation and spreading
of the brain activity was observed in the acute phase followed
by normalization of the motor brain activity in the chronic
phase. Decreased activity in the motor network in the acute
phase was observed in all the patients with poor motor performance.
While patients with good recovery demonstrated
increase and lateralization of the motor network activity in the chronic phase, patients with poor recovery demonstrated
increase and spreading of the brain activation. These findings
may suggest that the motor status may reflect the pattern in
which the motor network reorganized after stroke.</p><p>

biology. Among the only defintively identified examples to
date are the Sertoli cells, which maintain and regulate the
stem cell population of the testis. Because Sertoli cells produce
a remarkable variety of secretable proteins, including
neurotrophic factors, neurofilaments, and so forth, we hypothesized
that these cells might be capable of influencing
the development of nontestis precursor cells. To test this hypothesis,
we established cocultures of postnatal mouse Sertoli
cells and PC12 cells transfected with yellow fluorescent
protein. These cells produce catecholamines, and when
treated with nerve growth factor, stop dividing, grow neurites,
and develop electrical excitability. Sertoli cells were harvested
from week old mice, and were seeded together with
PC12 cells on coverslips. At various times, the cultures were
fixed and processed for immunofluorescence for neuronal
markers, including tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), NeuN and
MAP-2 and glial markers (eg, clusterin. GFAP and CNPase).
Two weeks after exposure to the Sertoli cells, the PC12 cells
in the cocultures extended long branched processes and began
to resemble neurons, while the PC12 cells cultured alone
were morphologically unchanged. Other changes observed
included upregulation of clusterin in the PC12 exposed to
Sertoli compared to the PC12 cells alone. Our data indicate
that Sertoli cells are able to influence undifferentiated, nontesticular
cells towards a neural fate. This may suggest that
niche cells, represented here by the Sertoli cells, possess a
broad potential for progenitor cell interactions.</p><p>

and testis has been of interest to neurobiologists for some
time. These are typically glial proteins such as GFAP, vimentin,
clusterin and metallothionein I/II, but also some
neuronal ones such as neurofilament protein and neurotrophin
receptors. In characterizing another zinc homeostatic
protein, ZnT-1, its expression was observed very
strongly in oligodendrocytes and the Sertoli cells of the testis.
To explore how these two, very different yet surprisingly similar
supporting cells manage and utilize zinc, we assessed
the influence of zinc and zinc homeostatic proteins in an
ex vivo model of testis. Immunofluorescence for phenotypic
markers of Sertoli and germ cells indicates that the cultures
were highly similar to acute slices taken from postnatal
mouse testis. The existence of L-type calcium channels
(LTCC), through which zinc and cadmium (Cd2+) as well
as calcium permeate into Sertoli cells, was demonstrated by
means of fluorescent live cell imaging. After loading the explants
with the calcium-sensitive dye, Fura-2AM, depolarizing
conditions were created and fluorescence changes monitored
over time. Application of the LTCC-blocker, nimodipine,
significantly decreased Ca2+, Zn2+, and Cd2+ influx,
attesting to the presence of an active LTCC. We then demonstrated
that exposure of the explants to Zn2+ and Cd2+ induced
upregulation of the glycoprotein, clusterin, which has
been associated with apoptosis in both germ cells and neurons,
as well as ZnT-1, which was recently shown to regulate
the LTCC. Thus, Zn, which normally permeates into both
Sertoli and neural cells through the LTCC, upregulates the
pro-apoptotic clusterin. Countering this is ZnT-1, also regulated
by Zn2+ (and Cd2+), and which itself reduces the entry
of Zn2+ and thereby the production of clusterin. These
findings provide evidence for common mechanisms involving
zinc signaling in neural and nonneural tissue.</p><p>

experiences is often strongly engraved. Odors are claimed to
be more closely connected to affect than other sensory experiences.
They can serve as potent contextual cues for memory
formation and emotional conditioning. Though traumarelated
smells have long been noted by clinicians to be precipitants
of traumatic memories in patients with posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD), very few reports have been published
that document this. Recently it has been found that an olfactory
stimulus can serve effectively as a CS in fear conditioning
paradigms and that the basic principles governing the acquisition
of emotional responses conditioned to auditory and
visual CSs can be extended to the olfactory system. However,
it is not clear whether as opposed to serving as apperceptive,
cue olfaction can serve effectively as part of the context. In
this work our main objective is to establish a methodological
approach for associating odor as contextualcue with a
traumatic event, based on the assumption that continuous, long lasting but not a brief exposure to the odor (in the presence
of another salient cue, from other modality) will be sufficient
for odor-contextual conditioning. Five or 6 days of
contextual-odor foot-shock association paradigm was sufficient
to establish long term contextual conditioning to the
odor. The traumatic memory for odor was assessed as freezing
behavior measured in a different context with the same
odor as part of the new context. However, 1 day contextualodor
stress association paradigm was not sufficient to create
contextual odor conditioning. The results indicate that contextual
odor conditioning is slow to develop. The possibility
that contextual odor conditioning is slow to develop but
once developed it forms a robust emotional memory will be
assessed in future studies.</p><p>

can be summarized in these following points: (1) cognitive

behavior (decreased executive function). (2) Physical
changes&#x02014;a reduction in prefrontal cortical volume and
increased subcortical white matter lesions. (3) Biochemical

synaptic plasticity and neurogenesis in the adult brain. Due
to its complexity, rodent models of ageing are valuable in assessing
the neurodegenerative processes leading to the cognitive
decline. In this work we have performed quantitative T2
MRI examination of young (4 months) versus adult (12&#x02013;14
months) rats in vivo and in vitro following formalin fixation.
Voxel-based morphometry was used to statistically compare
between the two groups on a pixel-by-pixel basis. In vitro
ANOVA maps of the two groups showed (at P &#x0003c; .05) specific
changes in white matter regions (corpus callosum and
internal capsule). The T2 in the white matter of the young
age group was higher than that of the adult group, opposite
to what expected in vivo. Indeed, the in vivo ANOVA maps
revealed a completely different pattern of changes. There T2
was increased at the adult group mainly in the thalamus and
cingulated cortex. These results suggest that formalin fixation
has differential effect on the aging brain as it most probably
fixates the adult brain differently than the young ones. In
addition, this fixation artifact seems to be much more significant
in areas of white matter. Therefore we need to examine
carefully fixated brains in aging.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8518" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ELECTRICAL STIMULATION OF THE BASOLATERAL

the basolateral amygdala (BLA) as essential for establishment

interfere with the ongoing neuronal plasticity and consequently
interfere with the stabilization of the activated memory

that BLA electrical stimulation following the longer retrieval

septin family, but being derived by alternate splicing
from the H5/PNUTL2/hcdcrel2a/2b gene, it differs in its
C-terminal structure from other products of this gene, and
from other septins. Inmany cell lines derived from peripheral
tissues, ARTS is localized to mitochondria, but upon apoptotic
stimuli it translocates to the nucleus (Larisch et al [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).
Neuronal ARTS (nARTS) is expressed in most areas of rat
brain as seen by immunohistochemistry, but in rat brain tissue,
as well as in primary cultures of rat cortical and cerebellar
granule neurons, is expressed in a shorter form (25 kDa)
than peripheral ARTS (32 kDa). nARTS lacks part of the Nterminal
amino acid sequence of peripheral ARTS, as shown
by its binding to an antibody specific to the C-terminal but
not the N-terminal sequence by immunoblotting. In addition,
confocal microscopy showed that in primary rat cortical
neurons prepared from E-18 embryos and grown for 7
days IV in neurobasal medium plus B27supplement, nARTS
is localized mainly to the nucleus but not to the mitochondria.
In SH-SY5Y, however, nARTS localizes to mitochondria.
Levels of nARTS were elevated as a result of different
insults in vitro as well as in vivo. In primary rat cortical neurons,
following withdrawal of B27 from the growth medium
there was a strong upregulation of nARTS, especially after 48
hours. In SH-SY5Y cells, nARTS occurs as the 25 kDa variant,
but following transfection with full-length ARTS and treatment
with the proteasome inhibitor MG132, the full length
form is also seen. This data indicates that nARTS might be
involved in neuronal death, but it is unclear whether its role
is proapoptotic or otherwise, which is currently under investigation.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B31"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Larisch</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Yi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Lotan</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>A novel mitochondrial septin-like protein, ARTS, mediates apoptosis dependent on its P-loop motif</article-title><source><italic>Nature Cell Biology</italic></source><year>2000</year><volume>2</volume><issue>12</issue><fpage>915</fpage><lpage>921</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11146656</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8654" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DYNAMICAL DISTRIBUTED CURRENT SOURCE MODEL

and localizing their cerebral sources are major challenges
for cognitive neuroscience, as the problem is ill posed.
Since there are more sources of electric field than sensors,
an infinite number of neural activity configurations can produce
the same measured potentials, and therefore constraints
must be set in order to limit the possible solutions. The majority
of current methods rely on some biologically or physically
implausible assumption, such as temporal independence
between regions of activity, vast spatial smoothness, or
approximation of large volumes with single dipoles. Despite
interesting developments in recent years, current methods
are yet to show robust and reliable results with real data. In
our study we seek to incorporate spatiotemporal constraints
derived from anatomy, connectivity, and electrophysiology.
We are developing a distributed current source model, with
spatial constraints for the locations and orientations derived
from structural anatomy (sMRI). In order to apply temporal
constraints based on anatomical and physiological data, a dynamical
network model is devised incorporating previously
studied neural population connectivity, conduction delays,
and impulse responses. The model is formulated in discrete
time difference equations, whichmake its analysis and implementationmore
efficient and straight forward. The dynamics
is defined up to parameters, which are to be determined such
that the projection of the activity onto the scalp electrodes
best fits the measurements. Once the dynamics parameters
are determined, the spatiotemporal evoked stream of activation
can be reconstructed and simulated. This approach may
eventually allow not only inference on sources distribution across time, but functional connectivity as well. We present
here the model equations and some simulation results of the
dynamics with arbitrary parameters.</p><p>

disorder (OCD), compulsive behavior is induced by attenuating
a signal indicating that a lever-press response was effective
in producing food. Compulsive behavior is evident as
excessive lever-presses that are not followed by an attempt
to collect food. The most effective treatments known today
for OCD are pharmacological treatments that use selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors and a behavioral treatment
that uses a technique of exposure and response prevention.
In severe refractory cases neurosurgery is sometimes performed.
Following the success of high-frequency stimulation
(HFS) in replacing lesions in neurologically-related neuropsychiatric
disorders including Parkinson's disease, dystonia,
and Tourette syndrome, the present study tested this technique
by assessing the effects of HFS of the subthalamic nucleus
(STN) on compulsive behavior in the model. In order
to differentiate between the effects of signal attenuation
and extinction per se, sham and STN HFS rats were tested
in an extinction test that was or was not preceded by signal
attenuation (post-training signal attenuation procedure and
regular extinction procedure, resp). STN HFS abolished the
&#x0201c;compulsive&#x0201d;-like behavior in rats undergoing signal attenuation.
These results might support the acceptance of HFS as
a treatment for refractory OCD and might suggest the STN
as a possible target area.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8775" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TOWARD ANIMAL MODELS OF FOOD DISORDERS:

classical conditioning is selected by the experimenter among
the behavioral repertoire emitted in response to the conditioned
stimulus (CS). In conditioned taste aversion (CTA),
the subject learns to associate a tastant (the CS) with delayed
toxicosis (an unconditioned stimulus, US) to yield taste aversion
(the CR). Although USs that induce visceral malaise are
particularly effective in CTA, the association of taste with delayed
negative internal states that could generate CRs that
are different from taste aversion should not be neglected.
Such acquired associations may contribute to the ontogenesis
and reinforcement of some types of eating and digestive
disorders. We have recently reported that a delayed
anxiety-like state, induced by the anxiogenic drug metachlorophenylpiperazine,
can specifically associate with taste
to produce CTA in the rat (Guitton and Dudai [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]). Here we
report that a similar protocol results in a long-term impairment
in social behavior in response to the conditioned taste.
This possibly represents a component of the anxiety that generates
a social CR in a type of protocol that commonly quantifies
only gustatory CRs. The acquired association of food
and social behavior may bear relevance to some eating and
social pathologies. This is hence a learned situation in which
food and company do not mix well.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B32"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Guitton</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Dudai</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anxiety-like state associates with taste to produce conditioned taste aversion</article-title><source><italic>Biological Psychiatry</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>56</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>901</fpage><lpage>904</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15576070</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8841" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GENETIC VARIATION IN THE ARGININE VASOPRESSIN

lower vertebrates with social communication, and in humans

altruism. To examine whether two AVPR1a promoter-region
repeat elements (RS1, RS3) are associated with differences in
money allocations in games that measure prosocial behavior
and to test whether there is a relationship between repeat
length and gene transcription. Participants played an online
version of the Dictator Game and the Social Values Orientation

mRNA was measured in 20 lymphoblast cell lines genotyped
for RS1 and RS3 using real time PCR. The sample consisted
of University students (60 men, 70 women) whose average age was 22.24 (SD = 3.82). Association using a tdt test was
observed for RS3 and sum of money allocated in the Dictator

RS3 length predicted allocation in the Dictator Game (1-

strengthen the association between AVPR1a and social cognition

whereby movements of the whiskers enable exceptional
proximal sensing capabilities. The sensitivity of the vibrissae
system to direction, amplitude, and frequency of whisker
stimulation implies that whisker movements should be precisely
controlled, despite their stereotyped patterning. We decomposed
whisker movements into translational and rotational
components, and found that the proximal 70% of the
whisker shaft lies flat in a plane and exhibits negligible deformation
during whisking in free air. Analysis of this rigid
portion of the shaft reveals that whisking involves rhythmic
movements in all dimensions. Some of the movement
components kept constant phase relationships from bout to
bout and some not, and whisking frequencies were modulated
at a rate 0&#x02013;5 Hz/s. The mystacial pad made translations
during whisking and usually not parallel to the whisker
rows. The pad may assume different vertical set-points, suggesting
rats target specific vertical zones for exploration. We
found that azimuthal rotation was coupled with torsional
rotation of the whisker shaft. Thus, a particular object can
be scanned along the circumference of the whisker follicle.
These observations add significantly to the complexity and
repertoire of vibrissal behavior and of mechanical encoding
within the follicle, and provide vital insights on how stimulus
selectivity of the trigeminal pathway can be exploited by
fine motor control. Altogether, these observations show that,
although stereotypical, whisking cannot be reduced to a onedimensional
movement.</p><p>

brain areas appear to play pivotal roles in the pathophysiology
of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Mechanisms
which mediate adaptive and maladaptive changes in
the brain in response to stress exposure are thus important.
Activity-regulated cytoskeletal-associated protein (Arc) is an
effector immediate early gene (IEG) which has direct effects
on intracellular homeostatic functions. Increased expression
of Arc has been associated with increased neuronal activity
and with consolidation of long-term memory. It may thus
play an important role in mediating experience-induced reorganization
and/or development of synaptic connections.
This study assessed the long-term expression of mRNA for
the Arc gene in selected brain areas in relation to prevalence
rates of behavioral response patterns and levels of circulating
corticosterone in an animal model of PTSD. The hippocampal
CA1 and CA3 subregions of individuals whose behavior
was minimally or partially disrupted in response to predator
scent stress demonstrated significantly increased levels of
Arc mRNA, than did unexposed controls. Rats whose behavior
was severely disrupted demonstrated no such upregulation.
Consistent with the hypothesis that the Arc gene has
a promoting effect on neuronal function and/or structural
changes, this study raises the possibility that Arc may be associated
with resilience and/or recovery after stress exposure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9182" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LONG-TERM DOWNREGULATION OF BDNF MRNA IN

BDNF interacts with components of the stress response
such as corticosterone, and plays an important role
in growth, maintenance, and functioning of several neuronal
systems. This study employed an animal model of PTSD to
investigate the relationship between prevalence rates of distinct
patterns of behavioral responses to predator stress, circulating
levels of corticosterone and local levels of mRNA for
BDNF, TrkB, neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and nerve growth factor

extremely disrupted by exposure selectively displayed significant
downregulation of mRNA for BDNF and upregulation
of TrkB mRNA in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus,
compared to animals whose behavior was minimally or partially
affected and to unexposed controls. The response was
consistent throughout the entire study only in CA1. The consistent
long-term BDNF downregulation and TrkB upregulation
associated with extreme behavioral compromise may
be associated with chronic stress-induced psychopathologic

disorder which preferentially strikes women. The hall
mark of AD is cognitive decline, and the glutamatergic system,
specifically the NMDA receptors, plays a major role in
cognitive processes. ApoE knockout (APOKO) is an animal
model of AD. We tested the hypothesis that NMDA receptor
availability will be lower in APOKO mice than in wildtype
mice. C57bl mice (wildtype and APOKO, 8&#x02013;10 months
old) were used in the experiments. Animals were decapitated
and brains were quickly removed and frozen for cryosectioning
in multiple consecutive series. Coronal brain sections
at the level of striatum and hippocampus were incubated
with the selective noncompetitive NMDA antagonist
[3H]MK801. Nonspecific binding was assessed on consecutive
sections in the presence of excess unlabeled MK801.
Washed and dried sections were scanned by beta imaging
and quantitative regional analyses were performed with beta
vision software. APOKO females (<italic>N</italic> = 11) had significantly
decreased NMDA binding compared to control females
(<italic>N</italic> = 7), which was also region-dependent [significant

regions (eg, CA1, 39.1%; DG, 38.4%; CA3, 37.5%)
which are linked to cognitive performance, while there was
no apparent difference in the striatum and cingulate cortex.
Since APO-related cognitive deficits were described, which
were larger in APOKO females than APOKO males (Raber

APOKO females (<italic>N</italic> = 11) and APOKO males (<italic>N</italic> = 10).
While there was a trend for lower NMDA binding in the

cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1) is the etiology and pathophysiology
of major depression. To explore the role of IL-1 in
chronic stress-induced depression and in some of its underlying
biological mechanisms, we used the chronic mild
stress (CMS) model of depression. Mice subjected to CMS
for 5 weeks exhibited depressive-like symptoms, including
decreased sucrose preference, reduced social exploration and
adrenocortical activation, concomitantly with increased IL-
1&#x000e2; levels in the hippocampus. In contrast, mice with deletion
of the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1rKO) or mice with transgenic,
brain-restricted over-expression of IL-1 receptor antagonist
did not display any CMS-induced behavioral or neuroendocrine
changes. The blunting of the adrenocortical activation
in IL-1rKO mice may play a causal role in their resistance
to depression, because removal of endogenous glucocorticoids
by adrenalctomy also abolished the depressive-like
effects of CMS. Reduced hippocampal neurogenesis, another
putative mechanism of depression, may also underlie IL-1's
involvement in CMS-induced depression, because whereas in
WT mice CMS significantly reduced neurogenesis, measured
by both BrdU and doublecortin immunohistochemistry, no
such decrease was observed in IL-1rKO mice. Moreover, the
effects of CMS on both behavioral depression and neurogenesis
could bemimicked by exogenous administration of IL-1&#x000e2;
via osmotic minipumps for 4 weeks. These findings indicate
that elevation in brain IL-1 levels, which characterizes many
medical conditions, is both necessary and sufficient for producing
the high incidence of depression found in these conditions.
Thus, procedures aiming at reducing brain IL-1 levels
may have potent antidepressive actions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9418" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ERUCYLPHOSPHOHOMOCHOLINE-INDUCED CELL

(APC) are membranophile agents not directly targeting
cellular DNA. Erucylphosphohomocholine (ErPC3) is
a promising APC member for parenteral administration. It
exerts strong anticancer activity and is a potent inducer of
apoptosis, even in highly chemoresistant cells. Initial mechanistic
studies indicate that mitochondria are central to
ErPC3-induced apoptosis. Mitochondria are one of the major
sources of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative stress
and the redox state of a cell are supposed to play a pivotal
role in regulating apoptosis. The 18 kDa peripheral-type
benzodiazepine receptor (PBR) exerts various cell functions
and is involved in a functional structure designated as the
mitochondrial permeability transition pore. Published data
suggest that PBR is a target for ROS which induce the formation
of PBR polymers modulating PBR-mediated functions.
We have shown previously that the classical PBR ligands
PK11195 and Ro5-4864 both prevented apoptosis induction
by ErPC3 in human glioma cells. In a first attempt
to analyse a possible correlation between ErPC3, PBR, and
ROS we investigated the role of ROS in ErPC3-induced cell
death, using A172 and U373MG cells and different ROS inhibitors.
The antioxidant butylated hydroxyanisole was able
to inhibit ErPC3-induced apoptosis and cytotoxicity in both
cell lines whereas iron chelators (deferoxamine, phenanthroline)
blocked apoptosis in U373MG cells only. Sulfhydryl
reagents (dithiotreitol, glutathione), superoxide dismutase,
N-acetylcysteine and Trolox had no effect on ErPC3-induced
cell death. Catalase partly inhibited ErPC3-mediated apoptosis
in A172 cells. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis
that hydrogen peroxide induced by ErPC3 acts close
to its site of generation in A172 cells, whereas hydroxyl radicals
produced in U373MG cells trigger the execution of apoptosis
by inducing opening of the mitochondrial permeability
pores.</p><p>

new insight into the mechanism by which processes activin
A and B regulate neuronal neuroprotection. We show
that activin A or B (10&#x02013;25 ng per mL) significantly reduced
cell death, as induced either by serum deprivation, the
parkinsonism-inducing neurotoxin, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-

neuroblastoma cells. We found that transient transfection
of activin A and B in SH-SY5Y, rat pheochromocytoma
PC12 and human U-87-MG glioma cells resulted in
protection of cells from apoptosis, compared with respective
cells transfected with a control plasmid. The neuroprotective
effect involved inhibition of the cleavage and activation of
procaspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase (PARP), induction
of antiapoptotic proteins, Bcl-2 and BclxL, and reduction
in the proapoptotic protein, Bad. This was accompanied
by inducing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase expression.
These results indicate that both activin A and B
share the potential to induce neuroprotective activity and
thus may have positive impact on aging and neurodegenerative

movements requires a model which can predict the neuronal
activity around a given movement, in a single trial. However,
the intertrial variability has been found to be much larger
than the average response. In a series of studies, A. Arieli and
colleagues have shown that a large portion of this variability
can be accounted for by the spontaneous (ongoing) network
state before the trial begins. To examine the nature of
this ongoing activity and its relation to behavioral trials we
modeled the dynamics of the ongoing network states in motor
cortex inherent in the local field potentials, from simultaneously
recorded multielectrodes in behaving monkeys. We
used the LFP as a measure of the network state, as it is believed
to reflect the synaptic activity from a large ensemble of
neurons in the vicinity of the microelectrode. We trained a
linear dynamical system with Gaussian noise (Kalman filter),
using the LFP signal from one electrode as our observations,
and learned to predict the LFP signal of another electrode&#x02014;
our states. After training the model on data taken from periods
of ongoing activity (when the monkey is resting from
the task and not moving the manipulandum), we tested the
model on the trial-by-trial fluctuations (single trial minus
average) during reaching trials. Our model significantly outperformed
the correlations inherent between the electrodes.
Thus the statistics of the ongoing activity can account for a
portion of the intertrial variability during trials. We examined
the stationarity of these statistics by training the model
on data from different parts of the day, as well as, fromdifferent
epochs of ongoing activity. In addition, we examined the
predictive power of the model on data segments with oscillations
in specific frequencies (eg, gamma-band oscillations),
or on limited frequency bands of the LFP signal.</p><p>

some debate. We recorded neuronal activity in AES and in A1

Themajority of neurons that had significant response to VAS

in the posterior AES (pAES) where their proportion
among all auditory-sensitive neurons was higher than in anterior

preferentially to contralateral sounds. Neurons in AES had
their spatial selectivity distributed more homogenously than
A1, with 25 percent of the space selective neurons tuned to
central locations, three times more than in A1. Furthermore,
the proportion of neurons preferring frontal locations was
somewhat higher in pAES compared to aAES. Thus, pAES

Demonstration of interactive signaling could prove
relevant with respect to the treatment of several neurological
disorders. This cross-talk aspect was addressed in the
model system of PC12 cells (wild type, trkA-negative, and
trkA overexpressors). Chronic treatment of PC12 cell clones
with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone elicited a 50% reduction
in p75NTR neurotrophin receptor mRNA and protein
expression levels, as evidenced by results obtained from
RT-PCR, northern, and western blotting experiments. This
down regulation of p75NTR was effectively antagonized
by the selective antagonist for corticosteroid type-2 receptor
(GR-2), mifepriston (RU-486) which is considered for
Alzheimer's disease treatment. The dexamethasone-induced
down regulation of p75NTR was associated with an enhancement
of both basal and NGF-stimulated trkA phosphorylation.
These results suggest that a transcriptional mechanism
underlies glucocorticosteroid induced-down regulation
of p75NTR receptor that, in turn, may affects the cooperative
interaction between p75NTR and trkA receptors. Since
chronic exposure to high glucocorticoid levels had been associated
with attention, concentration, and memory deficits,
the glucocorticosteroid induced-down regulation of p75NTR
receptor, which was also reported in vivo, may represent a
novel, additional mechanism contributing to the neurodegeneration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9733" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS OF ZEBRAFISH

in the central control of reproduction in all vertebrates. There
are three main populations of GnRH neurons, located in
the terminal nerve ganglions (TNg), hypothalamus and midbrain
(MB), which express different forms of GnRH. In zebrafish
(Danio rerio) the TNg and hypothalamic populations
express GnRH-I and the MB population expresses GnRHII.
The embryonic origin of GnRH-I neurons is the olfactory
placode. During development, they undergo posterior
migration and settle in the TNg and hypothalamus. Towards
understanding the molecular mechanism that determines
their site-specific expression, their promoters are being
functionally analyzed in vivo using transient expression
assays in developing embryos. A construct expressing EGFP
under the control of the GnRH-I promoter (1.3 kb) and the
first intron (1.1 kb) was microinjected into zebrafish zygotes
and EGFP expression was continuously documented in live
embryos for several days. Specific expression was identified
within the olfactory bulbs as early as 1 day post fertilization.
Promoter deletions have identified a minimal promoter of
253 bp which was sufficient in driving specific expression.
Further promoter deletions resulted in reduced specific expression
of EGFP, increased ectopic expression, and finally
in no expression. These results indicate a complex control
mechanism of GnRH-I expression, probably involving multiple
factors which are responsible for enhancement of specific
expression of GnRH-I gene. Putative transcription factors
that are involved in this mechanism will be identified
and will be tested in a transgenic zebrafish line that expresses

repetitive behavior in patients with autism. Recently, a positive

disorders and is characterized mainly by progressive
loss of dopaminergic neurons. In the past decade,
mutations in several genes have been identified as mediating
familial PD. Mutations in DJ-1 lead to early onset autosomal
recessive PD. Recently, changes in DJ-1 protein have been
demonstrated in brains and cerebrospinal fluid of patients
with sporadic PD, implying that DJ-1 may also have a role in
the more common nonhereditary form of the illness. So far,
studies have shown that DJ-1 is protective against oxidative
stress, but the exact mechanism of action is unknown. The
metabolism of dopamine induces formation of toxic reactive
oxygen species (ROS) and their accumulation is implicated
in the special sensitivity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons
to oxidative stress and degeneration in PD. Here we show
that exposure of human neuroblastoma cells to dopamine
or to toxins implicated in PD led to rapid upregulation of
DJ-1. This upregulation of DJ-1 was abolished by treatment
with the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine, indicating that DJ-1
upregulation was mediated by ROS. Overexpression of DJ-
1 increased cell resistance to dopamine toxicity and reduced
intracellular ROS. Contrary effects were achieved when DJ-1
levels were reduced by SiRNA. Moreover, we found that DJ-1
affects intracellular dopamine homeostasis and reduced free
intracellular dopamine. These observations suggest a novel
mechanism in which ROS, generated by increased cytoplasmic
dopamine, lead to rapid upregulation of DJ-1, which in
turn protectively reduced free intracellular dopamine. This
might explain why mutations in DJ-1 trigger early onset PD
and suggest that pharmacologic upregulation of DJ-1 may
represent a novel therapeutic target for PD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9867" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CEREBELLAR CORTICAL NEURONS EXHIBIT

in their time dependent firing patterns. Some neurons exhibit
bimodal firing patterns in which neurons alternate between
periods of high firing rates (up state) to periods of quiescence
(down state). Intracellular recordings from Purkinje
cells in cerebellar slices showed that the bimodal firing pattern
reflects a bistable membrane potential. Recently it has
been shown that the membrane potential of Purkinje cells
in intact, anesthetized brain is also bistable. This finding was
challenged by a report claiming that Purkinje cells in awake
animals are continuously in their up state and quiescent periods
of Purkinje cells could not be detected in awake animals.
We reexamined this issue by implanting microwire arrays
into the cerebellar cortex and recording activity of cerebellar
cortical neurons while animals walked freely in their home
cages. An array of 32 isonel coated tungsten microwires (35
microns in diameter) was implanted into the posterior part
of the cerebellar vermis. After about 10 days of recovery, we
observed high levels of spontaneous activity. The majority of
the clearly sorted single units displayed epochs of high firing
rates followed by prolonged quiescent periods. For the identification
of Purkinje cells we compared these recordings with
recordings under isoflorane anesthesia of the same animals.
Although the transition from anesthetized to awake state was
accompanied by an increase in firing rate, the bimodal pattern
was clearly observed. These results show beyond a doubt
that cerebellar cortical neurons recorded chronically in freely
moving animals exhibit bimodal firing patterns.</p><p>

Among the behavioral problems related to this syndrome
are hyperactivity and autistic-like behavior. In the
present study we examined the effect of perinatal GABA enhancement
on mice behavior, and the developmental regulation
of the GABA synthesizing enzyme (GAD) as a possible
underlying mechanism. Newborn balb/c mice were injected
(subcutaneous) daily with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin
(GVG; 50mg/kg) or vehicle (CT)&#x02014;during postnatal
days 4 (P4)&#x02013;P14. The adult mice were tested for social behavior
in a three-compartment arena, GVG adult mice showed
lower frequency of entries to the area consisting a cage with
a mouse (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .03, <italic>F</italic> = 4.3), and a similar number of entries
to the area consisting an empty cage. GVG adult mice
showed a lower rate of entries to the area with an unfamiliar
mouse (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .02, <italic>F</italic> = 5.1), while no differences were observed
in entries to a familiar mouse area. In addition, hypoactivity
was shown in GVG mice in all compartments, as expressed
in slower movement and a shorter distance. Thus,
we suggest that the lack of initiation of social interaction by
GVG mice is specific to social orientated behavior. Hypoactivity
of GVG adult mice correlates with previous results
in the open field test. In contrary, P14 mice showed hyperactivity.
Analysis of mice hippocampi by western blot showed
a suppression of GAD, on P14 GVG treated newborns (65%
of CT; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). The long-term consequence on GAD was
an up-regulation, as demonstrated by an increase in GVG
mice (147%; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). The synaptic vesicle protein VAMP
increased in GVG adult mice hippocampi by 2 folds compared
to CT (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c;5), suggesting that the increase in GAD
was due to synaptogenesis. We conclude that perinatal GABA
enhancement induces differential short- and long-term behavioral
modifications, which might be directly mediated by
alterations in GABAergic synapses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9990" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LYMPHOCYTE G-PROTEIN RECEPTOR KINASE (GRK)3

<italic>Background</italic>. Neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain is
part of a compensatory plastic-like mechanism that, under
regular conditions, maintains homeostasis between neuronal
cell birth and death. We have recently shown that the allele
E4 of apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4), the most prevalent genetic
risk factor of Alzheimer's disease (AD), inhibits synaptic
plasticity and prevents the improvements in learning and
memory which are induced by environmental stimulation.
<italic>Objective(s)</italic>. In the present study, we investigated the extent
to which the cognitive and synaptic impairments of the
apoE4 mice following environmental stimulation are related
to the effects of apoE4 on either neuronal death or neuronal
birth. <italic>Methods</italic>. This revealed that the level of neurogenesis
in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) subfield under regular
conditions is elevated isoform specifically in the apoE4
transgenic mice. Furthermore, environmental stimulation,
which elevated the levels of neurogenesis in the DG of apoE3
transgenic and wild-type mice, had the opposite effect on
the apoE4 mice, in which it triggered apoptosis and reduced
neurogenesis. Analysis of the stages of the neurogenesis cascade
which are affected by apoE revealed that the first lineage,
which is activated by apoE3 upon environmental stimulation,
is progenitor cells which contain double-cortin and
no nestin, and that the stimulation of neurogenesis by apoE4
under regular conditions is further upstream and is associated
with activation of progenitor cells which contain both
doublecortin and nestin. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. These animal model
findings suggest that, whereas measures such as environmental
enrichment which enhance neurogenesis may be beneficial
to apoE3 positive patients, they could be harmful when
applied to patients who carry apoE4. Conversely, antiapoptotic
treatments may be more effective in apoE4 than in
apoE3 patients.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10066" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INHIBITION OF THE LEFT DORSOLATERAL

to schizophrenia is a potentially far-reaching research and
clinical tool, but there is no indication yet on how to access
the core of this devastating disease. We previously showed
that perturbation of a motor task (finger tapping) allows for
the separation of motor and timing mechanisms, and reported
the appearance of two abnormal finger trajectories
that resulted from TMS (&#x0201c;stalls&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;doubles&#x0201d;), of which
both healthy subjects and patients with schizophrenia were
unaware. A phenomenon that appears only in schizophrenia
patients is the appearance of cognitive lapses during finger
tapping, in which the subjects miss a tap or two. Lapses
were found to be correlated with patients' positive symptoms
as diagnosed by PANSS tests. We report here how lapses in
schizophrenia patients can be manipulated by external intervention.
In the first condition the attention component
was manipulated by introducing a parallel mental arithmetic
task. This significantly aggravated the occurrence of lapses
in patients but not in healthy controls. In the second condition
the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (L-DLPFC) was
inhibited prior to the initiation of the tapping task. Surprisingly,
this almost completely relieved these lapses. Interestingly,
the DLPFC has been previously associated with high
executive functions and altered activation of it seems to be
specific to the core disease process of schizophrenia. The
fact that inhibition of the L-DLPFC improved the performance
of schizophrenia subjects suggests that it is a component
in the network governing finger tapping. Moreover,
this network seems mal functional in schizophrenia, and removal
of the L-DLPFC component can restore it to healthier
function. Our results support the disconnection hypothesis
of Schizophrenia and demonstrate the ability to use TMS
as a means to manipulate and probe the components of a
distributed network in both the healthy brain and the ill
brain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10144" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DIFFERENCES IN THE TMS-EVOKED EEG RESPONSES

deficits and symptoms in schizophrenia. Recently the combination
of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and electroencephalography (EEG) was suggested as a means to
study functional connectivity in the intact human brain. In
this preliminary study a widely used 24-bit EEG recording
system was used together with a novel artifact correction
method to study EEG responses to TMS perturbations in patients
diagnosed with schizophrenia and in healthy subjects.
In healthy controls TMS stimulation at the vertex evoked a
sequence of three clearly circumscribed peaks around 29ms,
43 ms, and 59 ms after the stimulus. In patients no clear response
pattern was observed. Some activation peaks seen
in controls were completely absent in patients while others
were reduced in amplitude and differed in their scalp potential
distribution. These findings demonstrate that there is
a difference between healthy subjects and patients with respect
to the EEG responses evoked by TMS and suggest that
these responses can be used to study changes in brain connectivity
and responsiveness in schizophrenia. Our observations
are consistent with the results of a recent study where
recordings were performed using a sophisticated artifactresistant
EEG system. However, the method introduced here
opens a way for a much wider group of researchers and clinicians
to study TMS evoked potentials which may lead in
the future to their use as a diagnostic tool in routine clinical
practice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10264" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ENDOGENOUS POLYAMINES REGULATE

Na+ channels in the soma and proximal dendrites of these
neurons produce surprisingly few late openings as compared
to dissociated cell preparations. We therefore postulated that
there exists a soluble factor extrinsic to the Na+ channel protein
that constrains these late openings. We focus our attention
on polyamine (PA) substances (spermine, spermidine,
and putrescine) which are present in all eukaryotic cells,
can be released from the cells, and are known to affect gating
of numerous types of ion channels. Using cell-attached
and whole cell recordings from Layer 5 pyramidal neurons
in neocortical slices we found that partial depletion of PAs
by disrupting their synthesis causes a dramatic increase in
the probability of late openings of somatic Na+ channels
and in the amplitude of whole cell persistent Na+ current
(INaP). Restoration of PA levels by adding the exogenous
PAs blocked late channel activities and INaP. Our data suggest
that these effects are due to activity-dependent blockade
of Na+ channels by PAs. Thus, when Layer 5 pyramidal cells
were dialyzed with spermine-containing intracellular solution,
there was a dramatic frequency-dependent change in
action potential attributes, including a decrease in the maximumrate
of rise and a depression in spike amplitudes. These
changes, which were observed during 20 Hz spike trains,
were very similar to the activity-dependent effects of local
anesthetics and some anticonvulsants. Our findings identify
a novel mechanism whereby changes in PA metabolism,
either associated with normal brain states and stimuli or
with pathophysiological conditions, can profoundly influence
Na+ channel availability, and thereby modify neuronal
excitability.</p><p>

hypernociception in the incision area, involving sensitization
of primary nociceptors and of wide-dynamic range neurons

of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1, following
tissue damage-induced immune activation. IL-1 signaling
plays an important hyperalgesic role in basal and inflammatory
conditions. Specifically, we have demonstrated
that mice with genetic or pharmacological blockade of IL-1
signaling exhibit reduced basal pain sensitivity, do not develop
neuropathic pain following peripheral nerve injury,
and display delayed and attenuated autotomy scores. The
present study examined the hypothesis that IL-1 signaling
also plays a role in incisional pain, using (1) mice chronically
treated with IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) via osmotic
micropumps implanted 3 days prior to incision, and
their vehicle-treated or untreated controls; (2) three mouse
strains with genetic impairment of IL-1 signaling: deletion
of the IL-1 type I receptor (IL-1rKO), deletion of this receptor
with congenic background (IL-1rKOCg), or transgenic
over-expression of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1raTG),
and their wild-type (WT) controls. Postoperative pain was
induced using the plantar incision model, and mechanosensitivity
was assessed using the von-Frey filament test, before,
and up to 5 days following the incision. Whereas the three
wild-type strains developed significant allodynia in the operated,
compared to the nonoperated, hind-paw, all 3 mutant
strains did not display increased mechanical pain sensitivity
in either hind-paw. Vehicle-treated mice displayed significantly
increased mechanical pain sensitivity in the operated,
compared to the nonoperated, hind-paw. In contrast, IL-1ratreated
mice did not develop allodynia in either hind-paw.
These findings indicate that IL-1 plays a pivotal role in the

that both types of choice behaviors correspond to indifference
points, in which the generalized values of the actions are
equal. These generalized value functions differ in the amount
of temporal discounting of future rewards. In the case of
strong temporal discounting, the indifference point corresponds
to matching behavior. In contrast, when the temporal
discounting is weak the indifference point corresponds to
maximizing. We introduce a new concept called &#x0201c;matchimizing,&#x0201d;

Matchimizing corresponds to the indifference point

In thatmodel, the actions of the subject are generated
by tossing a biased coin, where the bias of the coin is adjusted
based on the product of reward and an eligibility trace that
keeps track of actions in the recent past. The properties of
matchimizing behavior are described for a model for addiction,

of repeated choices is proportional to the total reward derived
from that alternative, a phenomenon known as Herrnstein's
matching law. This behavior is remarkably conserved
across species and experimental conditions, but its underlying
neural mechanisms are still unknown. Here we propose
a neural explanation of this empirical law of behavior. We
hypothesize that there are forms of synaptic plasticity driven
by the covariance between reward and neural activity, and
prove mathematically that matching is a generic outcome of
such plasticity. Two hypothetical types of synaptic plasticity,
embedded in decision making neural network models, are
shown to yield matching behavior in numerical simulations,
in accordance with our general theorem. We show how this
class of models can be tested experimentally by making reward
not only contingent upon the choices of the subject but
also directly contingent upon fluctuations in neural activity.

whiskers across surfaces in a rhythmic forward and backward
motion. To determine how textures are transformed
into vibration signals in whiskers, we induced active whisking
in anaesthetized rats and collected records of the natural
movement of whiskers across surfaces. We found that vibrations
of whiskers across different textures are translated into
distinct frequency and amplitude profiles. These response profiles vary across whiskers and are dependent on the radial
distance of the texture and the resonant frequency of the
stimulated whisker. Finally, these response profiles are influenced
by the velocity of head movements and are highly variable.
These results suggest that texture discrimination may
require the integration of signals from multiple vibrissae to

memory of brief salient stimuli are far from being understood.
Camouflage images, in which the original is initially
unrecognized but then suddenly identified, either spontaneously
(insight) or with the aid of a visual or cognitive
hint (induced insight), are particularly suitable for investigating
these mechanisms. We have generated a set of camouflage
images by convolving pictures of real-world scenes
with a Gaussian kernel followed by black and white binarization.
Behavioral experiments verified that exposure to
the original produced abrupt switches from not seeing the
figure in the camouflage to seeing it vividly. We used fMRI
to investigate brain correlates of the encoding and longterm
memory of these stimuli. During the scan, participants
observed 30 images. Each trial consisted of a presentation
of the camouflage, followed by a solution event in
which the original and the camouflage alternated four times
at 2 Hz. Finally, the participants were asked whether they
recognized the object in the camouflage image before seeing
the original. Participants returned a week later and performed
a recognition test. The recognition of a camouflage
was verified by presenting the image with a grid-map of
numbers on it, and requesting the participants to identify
the location of a selected feature in the image by its gridmap
number. A voxel-by-voxel analysis of events that were
subsequently remembered versus those not remembered revealed
activation during the solution event in the right and
left superior frontal gyri and in the lateral occipital cortex
(LO). Weaker activations were also found in the left middle
frontal gyrus, right IPS, and right precuneus. In addition,
each observer was subjected to a localizer run, which is a
two-condition block design, alternating between pictures of
everyday objects and scrambled versions of the same objects.
This analysis reveals a significant encoding effect in the LO
regions.</p><p>

<italic>Background</italic>. Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a major neuropsychiatric
complication of both acute and chronic liver
failure. However, its pathogenesis is still unknown. It has
been suggested that the cognitive deficits characterizing this
state result from changes in some neurotransmitter systems
in the brain including the glutamatergic, cholinergic, and
monoaminergic systems. Endocannabinoids (EC) function
as neuromodulators via specific receptors. Recently the endocannabinoid
system was found to be involved in the vasodilated
state associated with liver cirrhosis. We hypothesize that
it might be involved also in hepatic encephalopathy. <italic>Methods</italic>.
Female Sabra mice were subjected to ligation of the bile duct
(BDL). Sham operated animals were used as controls. 10 days
post-surgery, animals receiving either vehicle or 1mg/kg 2-
AG were evaluated for cognitive function in the eight-arm
maze test. Neurological function was evaluated in the neurological
severity score (NSS) test, 3 weeks post-surgery. The
animals were sacrificed and their livers and brains were analyzed
for 2-AG levels by GC-MS analysis. Oxidative stress in
the liver was determined using TBARSmethod. <italic>Results</italic>. Brain
2-AG levels were not different between Sham and BDL mice 3
weeks post-surgery, but liver 2-AG levels elevated twofold in
BDL mice in comparison to Sham mice. Cognitive and neurological
functions were significantly impaired in BDL mice
and 2-AG ameliorated these deficits. MDA levels in the liver,
an indication to lipid peroxidation, elevated 1.5-fold in BDL
mice and returned to normal values following treatment with
2-AG. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. These results indicate an involvement of
the endocannabinoid system in the pathogenesis of HE. It
seems that its activation might have therapeutic potential. 2-
AG levels may rise in the brain in an earlier stage of the disease
and that may be the reason for a lack of difference after
3 weeks. 2-AG elevation in the liver may have an antifibrotic
effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10691" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CAN TOOL-USE CHANGE OUR MINDS?</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Makin</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="a346">

it has been suggested that these modifications of

a tool to move an object by the &#x0201c;far&#x0201d; stimulus. To control
for the sensory, motor, and attentional components of
the tool-use training, in an additional experiment, subjects
were scanned after 5 minutes of pointing at the object while
it was being moved by the experimenter. Following the control
training, we found an increased BOLD response (compared
to pre-tool-use) along the intrapareital sulcus (IPS)

to be activated specifically by visual stimuli near the hand.
We also found a smaller increase for the &#x0201c;far&#x0201d; stimulus after
tool-use in the anterior IPS. We suggest that the cortical
changes following tool-use cannot be explained simply
by the sum of sensory, motor, and attentional components of

small conductance (SK) Ca2 activated K channels generating
the medium afterhyperpolarization current (IAHP).
Paradoxically, blocking IAHP with apamin does not affect
spike output, in contrast to what was found in other types
of CNS neurons. Thus, the function of these channels in
CA1 PCs remains enigmatic. We have previously shown
that KV7 (KCNQ) K channels generating the low-threshold,
noninactivating M-type K current (IM), limit the magnitude
of the spike afterdepolarization (ADP), thus conferring
a regular firing phenotype in CA1 PCs. When IM is
blocked (eg, by linopirdine), the spike ADP markedly increases
in size, causing the PC to fire in burst mode. To
solve the mystery regarding SK channel function in these
neurons, we have put forward the following hypothesis. In
normal conditions IM activates more readily than IAHP,
thereby minimizing IAHPs influence on neuronal excitability.
However, when IM is down-modulated, IAHP activation
becomes critical for preventing excessive excitation. Indeed,
using a realistic computer model of a CA1 PC, we
could show that reducing IAHP hardly affects the spike ADP
as long as IM is operative. However, reducing IM causes
IAHP to play an increasingly more critical role in reducing
spike output. Congruently, when tested in hippocampal
slices, blocking IAHP with apamin had negligible effects
on the spike ADP and spike output in ordinary conditions.
However, when apamin was applied to linopirdine-treated
neurons, spike discharge wasmarkedly enhanced. These data
show that the role of SK channels in terminating spike discharge
is secondary to that of KV7 channels. Only when
the latter channels are down-modulated, SK channels furnish
a critical repolarizing drive. Given that KV7 channels are
subjected to down-modulation by many neuro-transmitters,
it is likely that in some physiological situations SK channels
play a critical role in controlling the spike output of
CA1 PCs.</p><p>

<italic>Background</italic>. The neurobiological mechanisms underlying
the clinical manifestations of posttraumatic stress disorder
(PTSD) include changes in synaptic efficacy and plasticity
in various brain areas. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) plays an important role in the growth, development,
and function of several neuronal systems. <italic>Aims</italic>. To
study the effect of in-context training prior to stress exposure
on vulnerability and resilience to the development of
acute and long-term behavioral changes in an animal model
of PTSD and to seek evidence for the involvement of neurotrophic
factors. <italic>Methods</italic>. Rats were divided into 4 <italic>groups</italic>.
Trained group: rats were trained in the Morris water-maze
(MWM) for 2 days to locate the hidden platform. Trained
+ stress group: rats were trained in the MWM and were exposed
to stress (under-water trauma) 24 hours later. Na&#x000ef;ve
group: na&#x000ef;ve rats. Na&#x000ef;ve + stress group: na&#x000ef;ve rats exposed
to stress. Behavioral performance in an elevated plus-maze,
acoustic startle response, and the MWM was tested 1 day and 7 days after exposure. Animals were subsequently sacrificed,
and brain areas dissected and analyzed for mRNA BDNF
and TrkB levels. <italic>Results</italic>. The expression of mRNA BDNF in
the hippocampus was downregulated by exposure to stress.
In contrast, in-context training prior to stress exposure prevented
the stress sequelae, and was strongly correlated with
enhanced BDNF and TrkB expression. Microinfusion of recombinant
BDNF into the lateral ventricles prior to stress
exposure attenuated the posttraumatic stress responses.
<italic>Conclusions</italic>. We suggest that training prior to stress exposure
may activate production of endogenous neurotrophic
signaling in the hippocampus, and thus provides intrinsic
cortical neurons with more neurotrophic support, enhancing
plastic changes in synaptic function and neuronal connectivity.
These changes could reinforce against the susceptibility
to stress exposure or enhance recovery from the initial
response.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10835" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR AND HPA AXIS

(1) performance of standard (STD) task and (2) adaptation
to visuomotor rotation. Monkeys were over trained on
the STD task but had to learn the visuomotor rotation task
within a single session (Paz et al 2003). We hypothesized
that the appearance of oscillations may have a relationship
to motor planning and performance. We found that oscillations
start to emerge after trial initiation and terminate,
with low variability, after target appearance (defined as &#x0201c;oscillating

in each task condition a significant linear relationship between
mean power of oscillations during oscillating period
and motor reaction time (time from go signal to initiation of
movement)&#x02014;a high power implies a relatively long reaction
time. When comparing between tasks, standard trials showed
reaction time and power of oscillations lower than during visuomotor
rotation trials. When examining the dynamics of
oscillating period along the recording day, we discovered that
both the tendency of oscillations to appear and the mean
power of these oscillations gradually increase. Changes are
pronounced in the beginning of the standard trials, following
stabilization and subsequent changes when switching to
visuomotor rotation. These results strengthen the linkage of
gamma oscillations to preparatory functions, alertness, and
attention. We speculate that strong oscillations may represent
the recruitment of learning mechanisms and attention
that can cause a longer reaction time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11006" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DRUG DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PREVENTION OF

brain wounds or shock waves, for example, due to explosions,
accidents, or violence. It is well known that the primary
injury of TBI is followed for hours and days by a process
of secondary injury. Mitochondria are one of the cell
organelles involved in secondary brain injury. Our studies
suggest that the mitochondrial translocator protein (TSPO)
plays an important role in the process leading to neuronal cell
death with secondary brain injury. We have shown in vivo
that classical TSPO ligands, such as PK 11195, can prevent
neurodegeneration due to excitatory amino acids, an important
factor in secondary brain injury after TBI. We also found
that reducing TSPO expression by genetic manipulation reduced
apoptotic levels. In particular, such TSPO knockdown
completely prevented apoptosis caused by a major contributor
of neuronal cell death, the excitatory amino acid glutamate,
and also by Abeta(1&#x02013;42), one of the causative agents
for the neuronal cell death in the neurodegenerative disease
of Alzheimer. Recently, we have developed compounds that
bind with high affinity to the TSPO and apparently block its
apoptotic function. These novel compounds reduced basal
apoptotic levels in neuronal cells, as well as apoptosis induced
by glutamate, which is known to be an important
causative agent for secondary brain damage, and also takes
part in neurodegenerative diseases. We envision that secondary
brain injury due to TBI may be prevented by providing
soldiers and paramedics with one of the drugs we have
developed, that is, soldiers and paramedics could carry such
medication with them and use it on site. This may reduce the

front-line treatment of bipolar disorder over 50 years, however,
the mechanism underlying the therapeutic action of this
drug is not completely understood. Li have been shown to
have a significant effect on the receptor-coupled second messenger
systems, the adenylyl cyclase (AC), by inhibiting the
generation of cAMP. However, this effect of Li received little
attention in recent years because AC is widespread, making
it difficult to understand its specificity. Recently it became
known that AC is the product of ten different genes encoding
ten isoforms which vary in structure properties and
tissue distribution. Since lithium may have differential effects on various AC isoforms, we have studied the effect of
lithium on AC activity in tissue culture where cells can be
transfected with a gene for a single form of AC. We further
examined the effect of Li on AC inhibition by quinpirole, a
D2 dopamine receptor agonist and on a phenomenon referred
to as AC superactivation, reflected in an overshoot increase
in cAMP accumulation occurring after chronic activation
of Gi/o-coupled receptors followed by withdrawal of
the inhibitory agonist. Li at 1 or 2mM did not inhibit basal
AC activity of any AC isoform but selectively inhibits AC5
activity by 25&#x02013;30% when stimulates by forskolin, a direct
activator of ACs, implicating a direct effect of the drug on
the enzymatic protein. Li significantly inhibits D1 dopamine
receptor stimulated AC5 by &#x0223c;50% suggesting the involvement
of Gs in this effect. Lack of an additive effect of Li and
quinpirole suggests that both effectors affect AC5 by interacting
with a similar site on the enzyme. Li does not attenuate
AC5 superactivation. Li's selective inhibition of AC5, an isoform
involved in mediation of dopaminergic transmission in
the brain, suggests a possible dopaminergic region-speceific
mechanism for the mood stabilizing effect of Li.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11167" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ASSOCIATION BETWEEN TRYPOTPHAN HYDROXYLASE

<italic>Objective</italic>. The main objective of this study was to examine
neuropsychological mechanisms mediating the association
between tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2) and attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). TPH2 encodes
the rate limiting brain enzyme in the synthesis of
serotonin. <italic>Methods</italic>. A continuous performance test (TOVA)
was administered to 344 participants diagnosed with DSM
IV ADHD who were also genotyped for 8 TPH2 intronic
SNPs. Association between TPH2 (single SNPs and haplotypes)
and ADHD and performance on the TOVA were tested
using robust family-based association tests as implemented
in the UNPHASED set of programs. <italic>Results</italic>. Weak evidence
for association was observed between 7 and 8 locus haplotypes
and participants with ADHD DSM IV combined type
(<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .05). Much stronger evidence for association was observed
between TPH2 single SNPs as well as haploytpes and
performance on the TOVA (errors of omission, response
time, and response time variability). Significant association
was also observed between TPH2 and improvement in TOVA
scores following acute methylphenidate (MPH) treatment.
<italic>Conclusions</italic>. At least three studies now show association between
TPH2 and ADHD. The current investigation strengthens
these findings. The current first study shows that risk
for ADHD conferred by TPH2 variants is partially mediated
by serotonergic mechanisms impacting on some facets
of executive function monitored by scores on a continuous
performance test. Importantly, improvement in TOVA performance,
especially on response time variability, following
acute MPH administration was also associated with TPH2
single SNPs and haplotypes. Future studies could therefore
gainfully address the function of serotonergic genes, and especially
TPH2, in predicting the long-term efficacy of psychostimulants
in treatment of this disorder.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11311" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IMMEDIATE POST-STRESSOR ALPRAZOLAMDOES NOT

Alprazolam was administered intraperitoneally and compared

observed in term of behavioral responses to single exposure.
Cue induced freezing was significantly greater in treated individuals

significantly increased vulnerability for sever long-term behavioral

this intervention significantly increased vulnerability to exposure

<italic>Background</italic>. Pop-out detection, that is, detecting a target in
an array of distractors, improves with learning. This improvement,
however, is specific to the target's position. In
this study we further explore this position specificity to better
understand the processing stage in which learning may
take place. <italic>Methods</italic>. Subjects viewed an array of spheres that
appeared briefly and was followed by a mask. In half of the
times one of the spheres in a specific location was odd in its
shape from shading information. Subjects judged whether
this sphere was an odd man out. After a few practice sessions
performance increased and then the target position was
changed in one of three different ways: (1) in its retinal position;
(2) in its relative position with respect to the distractors;
or (3) in its position relative to the subject's head. <italic>Hypothesis</italic>.
If learning is in a specific reference frame (retinal, objectbased,
or head-based) only displacement of the target in that
reference frame should lead to performance decrease. <italic>Results</italic>.
When the target position was displaced in its retinal location
compared to the learned position, performance decreased to
pre-learning level. In contrast, the other manipulations did
not affect performance level that was reached by the learning
process. <italic>Conclusion</italic>. Perceptual learning of shape from shading
is specific to the target retinal position but independent
of the target position relative to the screen or its relative position
within the elements array. This suggests that learning
of complex shape features occurs in the early visual stages, in
which the representation is strictly retinotopic.</p><p>

conserved calmodulin-binding domain and calcium-binding
motifs. As calcium is known to accelerate vesicle priming
in chromaffin cells, we investigated the physiological relevance
of calmodulin binding to Munc13 activity. The exocytotic
response of cells overexpressing ubMunc13-2W387R,
a mutant that is calmodulin-binding deficient, was considerably
lower compared to the responses of cells overexpressing
the WT protein, yet still larger as compared to control
cells. To evaluate if Munc13's priming activity depends on
[Ca2+], exocytosis was evoked under conditions of low basal
calcium concentration (&#x0003c; 100 nM), conditions that do not
support vesicle priming. Under these conditions, both proteins
showed proportionally reduced priming activity. However,
when calcium was kept high for several seconds, secretion
accelerated only in cells overexpressing the wild-type
ubMunc13-2 (that bind calmodulin), giving rise to S-shaped
release kinetics. These results demonstrate that the interaction
of calmodulin with ubMunc13-2 enhances vesicle recruitment
at high [Ca2+]. Next, we kinetically analyze the
result using our new kinetic model that comprehensibly reproduces
the dynamics of exocytosis with high accuracy. Using
the model we conclude that calmodulin's interaction with
ubMunc13-2 has a regulatory nature and that this interaction
is important for boosting the activity of ubmunc13-2
when intracellular [Ca2+] rises. Furthermore, it seems that
the ubMunc13-2 have a unique effect on the release which is
different from theWT chromaffin cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11604" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ADNP mRNA KNOCK DOWN: A NOVEL APPROACH FOR

with primary brain cancer. Although there is no generally
accepted therapeutic management for primary brain
tumors, a surgical approach is taken in most cases. However,
even following an apparently complete surgical removal, tumor
recurrence is still common. Therefore, novel noninvasive
therapies are required for that management of brain tumors.
The human activity-dependent neuroprotective protein
(ADNP) gene was mapped to chromosome 20q12-13.2,
a region associated with aggressive tumor growth, frequently
amplified in many neoplasias. ADNP was identified as a protein
secreted by glial cells that is regulated by vasoactive intestinal
peptide (Bassan et al, 1999). In human and mouse
brains, ADNP is expressed predominately in the cerebellum,
hippocampus, and cerebral cortex (Zamostiano et al, 2001).
The recent study of Steingart and Gozes (2006) showed a
neuroprotective activity for the protein ADNP. Furthermore,
it was demonstrated that ADNP regulates the expression
level of the proapoptotic protein P53 as part of the mechanism
by which ADNP protected neurons. This result corroborates
previous findings showing that inhibition of ADNP
expression by antisense oligodeoxynucleutides results in HT-
29 (colon cancer) cell death associated with increases in P53
expression. Here we show a dramatic enhancement of the
ADNP antisense effect on HT-29 cell viability through the
use of a transfection reagent that increases the uptake of the
ADNP antisense into the cells. We hypothesize that due to the
high expression level of ADNP in the central nervous system
and due to the potent effect of ADNP knock down on cancer
cell viability, ADNP antisense could present an alternative
therapy for brain tumor. Future experiments are ongoing to
explore the aforementioned hypothesis.</p><p>

release is a prerequisite for synaptic plasticity, we use
the fruit fly Drosophila to ask whether Synapsin has a role
in behavioural plasticity as well. We tackle this question for
associative olfactory learning in larval Drosophila by using
the protein-null mutant syn97 CS (Godenschwege et al 2004
European Journal of Neuroscience). We find that olfactory
associative learning in syn97 CS larvae is reduced to approximately
half of wild-type; responsiveness to the to-beassociated
stimuli and all required motor faculties, however,
are normal (Michels et al 2005 Learning and Memory). This
learning phenotype now is the basis for localizing the cellular
site(s) of Synapsin-dependent olfactory memory in the
larval brain. Therefore, we have used the GAL4 binary transcription
activation system to determine in which part(s)
of the brain Synapsin expression is sufficient and/or necessary
for memory formation. Concerning sufficiency, both
almost pan-neural and mushroom body restricted expression
fully rescue the memory defect of the syn97 CS mutant.
The expression pattern of Synapsin in these transgenic animals
is confirmed by anti-Synapsin immunohistochemistry. Therefore, the mushroom bodies are a sufficient site for
Synapsin-dependent memory; this conforms with the role of
the mushroom bodies in adult flies (Gerber et al 2004 Current
Opinion in Neurobiology). Concerning necessity, two
different approaches, with either local suppression of GAL4
by GAL80 or by RNAi are currently used to test whether
mushroom-body specific knock-down of Synapsin impairs

of peripheral inflammation. Although kinins are also
present in the central nervous system, their involvement in
neurological disease is not clear thus far. Kinins act via B1
and B2 receptors. B2 receptors are constitutively expressed
under physiological conditions. By contrast, the B1 receptors
are highly induced by proinflammatory agents. Kinins have
been shown to induce cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression
and synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), major mediators of
inflammation. Release of proinflammatory molecules by astrocytes
and increased COX-2 expression in the brain have
been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative diseases
including Alzheimer's disease (AD). Furthermore, functional
differences in kinase signaling induced by kinin receptors
have been linked to AD. Recent studies indicate that kinins
may be involved in induction of protein synthesis, pointing
to long-term effect of kinins. We examined the role of
BK and des-arg10-kallidin (a B1 agonist) in long-term regulation
of basal and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced synthesis
of PGs in primary neonatal rat astrocyte cultures.
Treatment of astrocytes with B1 agonist or BK for 15 hours
enhanced basal PGE2 synthesis about 2 fold, as measured
by radioimmunoassay. Also, BK increased LPS (0.1 &#x003bc;g/mL)-
induced PGE2 production by 1.5 fold. However, the B1 agonist
reduced LPS-induced PGE2 production by 35%. To
investigate COX-2 involvement in mediating kinins effects,
COX-2 protein expression was measured. Both BK and B1
augmented COX-2 levels by about 2 fold. On the other hand,
while BK elevated LPS-induced COX-2 levels by 2 fold, the

<italic>Objective</italic>. To study the duration and intensity combinations
that determine sound as constant (rather than transient)
by measuring the N1 complex (N1a and N1b) of eventrelated

were recorded from normal subjects in response to gaps in
bursts of binaural white noise. Within each burst, the pregap
noise was one of four durations at three intensities. Analysis
included waveform peak measurements and intracranial
source current density estimations, and statistical assessment
of the effects of pregap noise parameters on N1a and N1b
and their estimated intracranial source activity. <italic>Results</italic>. The
N-Complex was detected at about 100 ms and the minimum
noise duration for a double-peaked N-Complex was between
tens of milliseconds and just under 500 ms, depending on
noise intensity. In general, latency of N1a (at &#x0223c;90 ms) increased
while that of N1b (at &#x0223c;150 ms) decreased with decreasing
duration of the preceding noise. Their amplitudes
were affected by the preceding noise intensity. Source current
density was most prominent, under all stimulus conditions,
in the temporo-parietal regions, with the first peak (N1a) lateralized
to the left hemisphere and the second peak (N1b)&#x02014; to the right. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Constancy of sound is determined

(CPG) produces the rhythmic motor patterns required for coordinated swimming, walking, and running in mammals.
The output of this network is not constant. It varies
with time during execution of different motor programs,
during frequency modulation of neural signals (facilitation,
depression, fatigue) and during the deterioration of experimental
preparations. Therefore, analyses of the CPG output
should take into account the nonstationary nature of the
recorded signals. The present work uses uni- and bivariate
short-time Fourier transform(STFT) and wavelet-transform
(WT) algorithms to analyze nonstationary rhythmic signals
produced in human muscles and in isolated spinal cords of
neonatal rats. The STFT algorithm divides the time series
into consecutive overlapping or non-overlapping windows
and repeatedly applies the Fourier transform across the signal.
The WT algorithm decomposes the signal using a family
of wavelets varying in scale, resulting in a set of wavelet coefficients
presented onto a continuous frequency range over
time. Applying these techniques to computer synthesized signals
and to the recorded motor rhythmic patterns mentioned
above revealed that a modified Morlet WT algorithm was the
tool of choice for this type of analysis. Cross-WT and wavelet
coherence were then used to determine interrelations between
pairs of time series in time and frequency domains and
the Monte Carlo simulations against white noise were used
to examine the critical value for statistical significance. The
ability of the cross Morlet WT and cross-WT coherence algorithms
to efficiently extract the rhythmic parameters over
a wide range of frequencies (0.01&#x02013;500 Hz) with time will be
demonstrated and its possible implications to the analysis of
complex nonstationary output of spinal pattern generators
will be discussed.</p><p>

neurological syndrome (HPNS). HPNS is characterized
in humans by confusion, dizziness, impairment of cognitive
and motor performance, tremor, EEG changes, myoclonia,
and convulsions at higher pressures. Previous studies
suggested that such CNS hyperexcitability may be associated
with increased NMDA receptor (NMDAR) activity.
Recently, long-term exposure to high pressure was implicated
with professional divers neurological and memory
deficits. Glutamate excitotoxicity that induce neuronal death
is also attributed to excessive Ca2+ influx through NMDAR.
Therefore, we studied pressure effects on the isolated
NMDAR currents. Conventional rat hippocampal coronal
brain slices were prepared, constantly superfused with physiological
solutions gas-saturated at normobaric pressure, and
compressed up to 10.1 MPa with helium. Evoked field EPSPs
(fEPSP) were recorded from the CA1 pyramidal neurons.
Isolated NMDAR fEPSP were obtained under the conditions
of AMPA blocking (DNQX, 20 microM), GABAA
blocking (picrotoxin, 50 microM), and [Mg2+]<sub>0</sub> = 0. The
single fEPSP maximal initial slope (29%), amplitude (80%),
decay time (95%), and (ms*mV, 350%) were
significantly increased despite the known general decrease
in glutamate synaptic release. When 5 stimuli at 50&#x02013;100 Hz
were used, high pressure increased the frequency-dependent
depression (FDD) of the fEPSPs; however, the signal time integral
remained the same. When 5 stimuli at 25Hz were used,
high pressure induced a larger FDD, but the time integral was
significantly increased by 185%. The immediate changes in
NMDAR fEPSP may explain the short-term HPNS hyperexcitability.
Furthermore, the robust increase in fEPSP time integral,
which indicates Ca2+/Na2+ influx, suggests elevation
of cytosolic [Ca2+] to toxic levels. This may provide a novel
working hypothesis for explaining long-term pressure exposure
deleterious effects on professional divers.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11869" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ALTERATIONS IN HIPPOCAMPAL

question of how stress affects long-term potentiation (LTP)

the effect of an aversive and inescapable stimulus only.
In the current study we assessed the potential differences that
an aversive learning paradigm (contextual fear conditioning)
could elicit in hippocampal LTP/ LTD as compared to exposure
to elevated platform stressor. Three groups were tested:
control rats, rats that were exposed to the elevated platform
prior electrophysiological recording, and a group of rats that
was trained for contextual fear conditioning before recording.
In accordance with previous results, exposure to the elevated
platform stress completely inhibited the induction of
CA1 LTP compared to controls. In contrast, the level of potentiation
of the rats that underwent fear conditioning was
not significantly different from the controls, suggesting that
stress and fear conditioning could differently affect CA1 LTP.
The effect of fear conditioning learning on the induction of

that information calculated at low levels of the hierarchy
is always available for perception. We now questioned
this view, by systematically characterizing the conditions under
which the auditory system fails to optimally utilize lowlevel
binaural information for different perceptual tasks. We
measured binaural advantage for speech perception in noise
under diotic and dichotic listening conditions. Stimulus sets
included word pairs, which were either perceptually different
or perceptually similar. We manipulated factors that could
potentially hamper access to low-level information: nature
of perceptual task (identification or semantic-association)
and the consistency of presentation of binaural information
(consistent within a block or mixed). In addition, we conducted
a computer simulation aimed to quantify binaural
advantage given optimal information processing. We found
that utilization of low-level information depended on highlevel
factors. Specifically, for perceptually different words,
binaural advantage was maximal (9 dB), independent of task
and protocol. However, when high-level perceptual similarity
was imposed, maximal binaural advantage, as predicted
by the simulation, could only be attained under limited conditions:
in the identification task, it was only obtained in the
separate protocol. In the semantic-association task, optimal
benefit was never obtained. Our findings suggest that the
ability of our auditory system to efficiently utilize low-level
information is restricted, and dictated by higher level factors,
as perceptual similarity, rather than by low-level acoustical
similarity. Moreover, they imply that when on-line access to
high-level representations is required, access to precise information
may be impaired, even if it is necessary for task resolution.
We interpret these results in terms of reverse hierarchy
theory (Ahissar and Hochstein, 1997).</p><p>

information for the identification of words in noise,
under diotic and dichotic listening conditions. We manipulated
the consistency of binaural presentations, using two
protocols: consistent, in which binaural information was either
diotic or dichotic within a block, andmixed, in which diotic
and dichotic trials were randomly interleaved. We found
that utilization of binaural information in the mixed protocol
was inefficient (5 dB compared to 9.3 dB for consistent
protocol). We now tested an intermediate condition (&#x0201c;1-1&#x0201d;),
in which diotic and dichotic trials were alternated throughout
the block. Under this protocol, binaural advantage was
inefficient, similar to that of the mixed protocol, although the
binaural condition could be fully predicted on a trial-by-trial
basis. We further asked whether training on the 1-1 protocol
will improve the utilization of binaural information. We
trained two groups of subjects for 7 successive sessions on
one of the two protocols (1-1 and mixed, resp), and tested
transfer of learning to the other protocol. Subjects trained on
the 1-1 protocol gradually attained maximal binaural advantage
(&#x0223c;9 dB) within 5&#x02013;7 sessions and fully transferred this
benefit to the mixed protocol. In contrast, subjects trained on
the mixed protocol attained smaller improvements in absolute
thresholds, and gained almost no benefit from binaural

information, which is not initially accessible when stimulus
conditions vary across trials. However, improvement is
contingent upon some consistent structure in the sequence
of the presentation. Once acquired, this information is accessible
even under variable trial-by-trial conditions, as was

to GnRH during the female reproductive cycle is a
central dogma, the mechanism of which remains unresolved.
GnRH stimulates arachidonic acid (AA) release from the
gonadotrope LbetaT2 cells followed by a marked induction
of COX-1 and COX-2 by GnRH, which was mediated by
the PKC/c-Src/PI3K/MAPK pathway but not via transactivation
of the EGF receptor. COX1/2 act on AA to produce
prostaglandins (PGs) and GnRH stimulates PGE2, PGI2, and
PGF2alpha production. We considered that these PGs may
act in an autocrine manner to regulate gonadotrope function
and demonstrated that rat pituitary gonadotropes express
the prostanoids receptors EP1, EP2, FP, and IP while
EP3 and EP4 were localized to the prolactin and growth hormone
producing cells, respectively. PGF2alpha and PGI2, but not PGE2, inhibit GnRH receptor expression through
FP and IP receptors. The inhibitory effect of PGF2alpha
and PGI2 seems to be mediated by inhibition of GnRHstimulated
phosphoinositide turnover. PGF2alpha but not
PGE2 or PGI2, reduced GnRH-induction of LHbeta, but like
PGE2 and PGI2 had no effect on the induction of common
alpha, or FSHbeta. PGF2alpha, or the COX1/2 inhibitor, indomethacin,
inhibited and enhanced GnRH-induced LH secretion,
respectively, from rat pituitaries, but both had no effect
on FSH secretion. PGE2 and PGI2 had no effect on LH
and FSH secretion induced by GnRH. Hence, a novel insideout
signaling pathwaymediated by PGF2alpha-FP and PGI2-
IP, acting in an autocrine/paracrine loop, limits GnRH regulation
of the GnRH receptor, while PGF2alpha inhibits also
GnRH stimulation of LH but not FSH release. This mechanism
may provide a means for the cyclical responsiveness of
pituitary gonadotropes and the asynchronous LH and FSH
release during the female reproductive cycle.</p><p>

between magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) pathways,
and understanding how they contribute to perception
are critical to our understanding of the primate visual system.
Recent studies from our lab have shown the first conclusive
anatomical evidence for a strong P input to area MT
of macaque monkey. Both M and P layers of the LGN connect
disynaptically with areaMT, bypassing the more prominent
pathway through layer 4C of primary visual cortex (V1)
and likely reaching MT via Meynert cells in layer 6. Here we
use rabies virus as a retrograde transynaptic tracer to study
the contributions of M and P pathways to area MT through
layer 4C of V1. After MT injections with a 3 day survival
time, disynaptic label in V1 was found almost exclusively
in M-dominated layer 4Calpha with little in P-dominated
layer 4Cbeta. These results suggest that the most direct input
stream through layer 4C of V1 to MT is indeed dominated
by the M pathway. However, after an MT injection
with a 6 day survival time, allowing rabies virus to transport
across up to three additional synapses, transynaptic label was
found in all layers of V1 including P-dominated layer 4Cbeta,
confirming that MT receives strong indirect input from the
P pathway through layer 4C of V1. In an attempt to elucidate
the route by which this P pathway input reaches MT,
we made injections into areas V3 and V2, which also provide
input toMT. Only after certain injections into V2, likely
those that involved a cytochrome oxidase (CO) thick stripe
were substantial disynaptic label found in P-dominated layer
4Cbeta, making the thick stripes of V2 the most likely relay
for P pathway input through layer 4C of V1 to MT. Further
studies will be necessary to elucidate the functional contributions
of each of these unique input pathways toMT and to
better understand the complex interactions between the M
and P pathways of the primate visual system.</p><p>

the gamma-band power in the local field potential

fMRI signal is of high significance, both theoretically and
methodologically. Recently, conflicting measures of this coupling
have been reported. Here we show, by simultaneously
recording single-unit and gamma-LFP from multiple electrodes

neurons to gamma-LFP is variable.However, this variability
could be largely accounted for (<italic>r</italic> = 0.66, <italic>p</italic> &#x0226a; 0.001)
by the extent of correlated activity between neighboring neurons.
When comparing single-unit activity to BOLD signals,

firing rate, and instances where they appear not to correlate
to single-unit activity may be due to locally decoherent firing

medial nucleus of the thalamus of the anaesthetized rat while
presenting simulated texture stimuli. We found, as others,
that thalamic responses depress with repetitive constant velocity
whisker stimulation. In contrast, however, a change in
stimulus velocity relives this depression. Even more surprising
is the fact that neuronal responses hardly ever adapt to
complex whisker deflections which contain a broad range of
whisker velocities. These results suggest that thalamic neurons
may integrate synaptic inputs which may carry distinct
attributes of unitary stimulus.</p><p>

Our findings point to a novel role for AChEI which

neuroplasticity, and cognition by stimulating trophic
factors such as BDNF. Insulin-like-growth-factor-1 (IGF-1)
is a potent neurotrophic factor in the brain. Previous studies
have demonstrated that IGF-1 accelerates brain growth and
neuroplasticity. IGF-1 is regulated by different neurotransmitters
such as norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT).
Our aimwas to evaluate the effect of various antidepressants,
which act differently on 5-HT and on NE neurotransmitters,
on the expression of IGF-1 mRNA and receptor (IGF-
1R) in different regions of the rat brain and in U87, a human
glioma cell-line.Hypothalamus, frontal cortex, and hippocampus
were dissected fromWistar male rats treated with
clomipramine, reboxetine and fluoxetine administered orally
(15mg/kg &#x000d7; 3 days or 21 days). In addition, U87 cells were
treated with the same antidepressants (0.1micM&#x02013;20 micM).
IGF-1R expression was determined by Western blot analysis.
IGF-1 mRNA levels were assessed by semiquantitive PCR
reaction. After 3 days, reboxetine and fluoxetine slightly decreased
IGF-1R in the hypothalamus. After 21 days, reboxetine
and fluoxetine increased IGF-1 mRNA in the frontal
cortex and decreased it in the hippocampus. Clomipramine
increased IGF-1R and reduced IGF-1 mRNA in the frontal
cortex. In the hippocampus, clomipramine decreased IGF-1
mRNA. In U87 cells a high concentration of clomipramine
increased IGF-1R. Reboxetine and fluoxetine increased IGF-
1 mRNA and IGF-1R at low concentrations, and decreased
both parameters at high concentrations. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Different
antidepressants affect the IGF-1 system in different brain
areas in various ways. Reboxetine and fluoxetine seem to possess
the same pattern of activity. After 21 days, in U87 cells,
a biphasic effect was observed with reboxetine and fluoxetine.
We suggest that antidepressants, mainly selective 5-HT
and NE modulators, may affect neurogenesis by regulating
the IGF-I system.</p><p>

<italic>Objective</italic>. Study neural correlates of subjectively positive and
negative verbal stimuli, using the high temporal resolution of
ERP (event-related potentials) and LORETA (low-resolution
electromagnetic tomography). We have previously shown
brain response to negative stimuli, here we compare the response
to positive and negative stimuli. <italic>Methods</italic>. ERPs were
recorded from twelve right-handed subjects while listening
to first names and detecting 3 emotionally neutral names
that ended with a specific consonant from a list of 25&#x02013;30
names. Subjective affective valence of verbal distracters was
determined separately for each subject after the experiment,
using a structured interview based on a validated questionnaire.
For each subject, for each name, 3 scores were computed
based on the interview results: general subjective significance,
negative valence, and positive valence. For each
subject, the name of the person who hurt the subject the
most was chosen as the negative stimulus. A name with the
highest positive valence score and the lowest negative valence
score was chosen for each subject as the positive stimulus.
Event-related potentials (ERPs) were averaged separately for
each name, for each subject. The time courses of brain activity
to names with subjectively negative and positive valence
were compared to neutral names using LORETA. <italic>Results</italic>.
Enhanced activation to stimuli with subjectively negative
and positive valence (compared to neutral stimuli) involved
prefrontal cortex and auditory cortex and lasted until
at least 950 ms after stimulus onset. In general, activity was
lateralized to the left hemisphere (mainly prefrontal cortex)
for negative stimuli, and to both hemispheres for positive
stimuli. <italic>Conclusions</italic>. Brain response to subjectively negative
stimuli is more extended and bilateral compared to subjectively
positive stimuli. It seems possible to differentiate the

in several areas of the brain, taken together with zinc
toxicity, suggests that zinc permeation and sequestration into
organelles are highly regulated. Indeed, numerous zinc regulating
proteins are known, most prominently the ZnT family.
Using cellular imaging together with molecular tools for
overexpression and silencing, we have identified the cellular
mechanisms which underlie the reduction of toxic Zn2+
accumulation. The cellular system which maintains Zn2+
homeostasis consists of plasma membrane proteins, which
regulate zinc influx or extrusion and intracellular transporters
that sequester zinc into intracellular organelles. Our
work focuses on three major proteins, resembeling each of
these &#x0201c;modes&#x0201d;: the Na+/Zn2+ exchanger and ZnT-1 on the
plasma membrane, and ZnT-5 on vesicular membranes. We
show that a Na+/Zn2+ exchanger mediates an active extrusion
of Zn2+ and that ZnT-1 modulates the LTCC (L-type
calcium channel) in neurons and thus reducing Zn2+ influx
through this channel. In addition, we show that ZnT-
5 actively sequesters Zn2+ into intracellular compartments.
Working together, these proteins make a robust systemwhich
reduces cytoplasmic zinc concentrations, thus protecting the

their gating mechanism. It is, however, unclear whether
other subfamilies of TRP channels share the same voltagedependent

channels with high affinity via an open channel block mechanism,
which underlies the hitherto unknown mechanism of
TRPL voltage dependence. A mathematicalmodel describing
channel-Ca2+ interaction indicated that it is the dissociation
of Ca2+ from the open channel that underlies the observed
voltage dependence of the channel. Whole cell recordings
from a Drosophila mutant expressing only the TRPL channels
indicate that Ca2+ block also accounts for the voltage

K+ channels (Kv). Inactivation of Kv channels can occur by

(Kv7.1) channels does not exhibit the hallmarks of N- and
C-type inactivation. Inactivation of wild-type KCNQ1 channels
is invisiblemacroscopically (hidden) but can be revealed
by hooked tail currents which reflect recovery from inactivation.
Here, we found that removal of external Ca2+ produced
a striking voltage-dependent macroscopic inactivation
in WT KCNQ1 channels when expressed in CHO cells.
Adding external Ca2+ suppresses the macroscopic inactivation
with an EC50 of 1.5 micromolar and leaves intact
the hidden inactivation. This modulation of macroscopic inactivation
was specific for Ca2+, as adding external Mg2+
and other divalent cations, except for Sr2+, could not suppress
the macroscopic inactivation induced in Ca2+-free solutions.
Interestingly, high external K+ (50mM) did not prevent
the macroscopic inactivation evoked in Ca2+-free solutions.
We show that in WT KCNQ1, two distinct inactivation
processes coexist in Ca2+-free solutions, a hidden
and a macroscopic inactivation, which display distinct kinetics.
We elaborated a kinetic model that closely matches
the experimental currents, assuming two closed states (C1
and C2), two voltage-dependent open states (O1 and O2),
a fast voltage-independent inactivated state I2 (&#x0201c;hidden&#x0201d; inactivation)
and a slow voltage-dependent inactivated state
I1 (slow macroscopic inactivation). Mutagenesis studies and
structural modeling indicate that external Ca2+ ions are
tightly coordinated by two glutamate residues located at the
outer pore in the turret region. In all, our results reveal
a new mechanism of inactivation whereby external Ca2+
exquisitely controls KCNQ1 channel gating by preventing relaxation
into slow macroscopic inactivation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12820" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PRETREATMENT WITH CLOZAPINE BUT NOT

changes in visual stimuli such as aging or maturing of
faces. To investigate the mechanisms that underlie the ability
of the brain to maintain such an adaptable representation
of visual objects we designed the following psychophysical
paradigm. The memory of a face was established by training
observers to recognize a small set of faces by names. Subsequently,
for multiple daily sessions, observers repeated a
task of identifying whether a presented face belonged to the
memorized set or not. Stimuli were presented in randomly
interleaved trials of memorized faces, new faces, and faces
from a morph sequence&#x02014;face stimuli gradually transforming
from one memorized face (source) to another distinguishable,
nonmemorized face (target). In the present study,
in each daily session observers were exposed only to a portion
of the morph sequence: starting from the source, every
day the morph faces that were shown drifted slightly towards
the target. Initially, only the morph images close to the source
were identified as belonging of the memorized set. As the
task continued, for 3 out of 4 observers this protocol led to
a gradual drift in the identification of the morph sequence&#x02014;
gradually additional morph images were identified as memorized,
until at the end of practice even the target face was
identified as memorized. After the practice these observers named the target as the source, rated all images of the morph
sequence as very similar to their memory of source, and,
unlike with the previous repetitive protocol (ISFN 2005),
rated the source as less familiar than before practice. These
results point to the potential of this protocol to implicitly affect
memory of prelearned faces, and demonstrate that longterm
memory of objects can be modified by exposure to
stimuli of gradually changing similarity. The results will be
discussed within the context of an attractor-based neural network
with novelty-dependent learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12879" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EVIDENCE THAT PRENATAL MATERNAL SSRIS THERAPY

the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes in SSRIs exposed
neonates. The aim of our study was to determine the
anthropometrical parameters and the hormonal profile of infants
exposed to prenatal maternal SSRIs. Twenty two infants
of mothers treated with different SSRIs during pregnancy
and 20 control infants were included in the study. Cord blood
level of cortisol, IGF-1, Prolactin, TSH, DHEA, DHEAS, and
urine 5HIAA (serotonine metabolite in the urine) were determined
in the two groups. Neonatal withdrawal symptoms
were obtained in the SSRIs group using the Finnegan score.
We have found in newborn males that birth weight, length,
head circumference as well as IGF-1 and DHEAS levels were
significantly lower than parameters found in males control
group. In female neonates, length and cortisol levels were
significantly lower than in female controls. In both sexes
of SSRIs-exposed neonates, plasma TSH levels were significantly
higher than in controls and a total of 27% of the
newborns showed hypothyroidism. In the SSRIs infants, the
Finnegan score was positively correlated, though not significantly,
with cord blood cortisol (<italic>r</italic> = 0.4, <italic>P</italic> = .09) and
negatively correlated, close to significance, with ECG QTc
interval (<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.45, <italic>P</italic> = .07). Birth weight was positively

Cord IGF-1 and urine 5HIAA were negatively correlated
(<italic>r</italic> = &#x02212;0.42, <italic>P</italic> = .06). In conclusion, infants exposed to SSRIs
in utero show impaired intrauterine growth, a tendency
toward decreased IGF-1, and high frequency of hypothyroidism.
It seems that follow-up of these children is of great
importance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12997" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MEMORY COMPENSATION IN THE BLIND:

of the scene, the perception of space is highly dependent
on memory. In specific, serial memory, indicating the order
in which items are encountered, may be especially important
for the blind to generate a mental picture of the world.
We compared the performance of 19 congenitally and totally
blind participants and 19 sighted controls in two types
of memory tasks: item memory (IM) and serial memory
(SM). We found that on average the congenitally blind are
better than their sighted peers in both item memory and
serial memory tasks. However, the blind's advantage is far
greater in serial memory, and it is most pronounced in the
recall of long sequences of words in their correct order. The
blind are superior to sighted in their serial memory capabilities
even in conditions in which IM performance is equal
in the two groups, indicating that their SM advantage is not
a byproduct of better item memory. Furthermore, the blind
improve their performance across repetitions in both IM and
SM more than their sighted peers. Once again, the blind's superior
improvement (compared to the sighted) is the greatest
in SM while it is more modest in the IM tasks. Blind's superior
improvement is even more conspicuous for the recall
of long sequences. We argue that the blind' clear advantage
in SM capabilities is a result of their blindness: unlike their
sighted peers, blind people typically experience the world as
sequences of events. Holistic impressions of scenes are therefore
highly dependent on memorizing the events according
to their serial order. We conclude that blind's superior performance
in serial memory is therefore a classical case of cognitive
compensatory adjustment.</p><p>

on its context. Novelty detection is an example of a vital
context-dependent task performed by the brain. Here we
attempt to characterize a neuro-correlate of novelty detection,
stimulus-specific adaptation (SSA) in the midbrain and
forebrain sound localization pathways of the barn owl. Two
paradigms were used to characterize SSA. One is the oddball paradigm, based on presenting probabilistic stimuli in which
two differing stimuli are presented with different probabilities:
rare and frequent. The second is a novel paradigm
of repetitive stimulations in a constant order, creating the
equivalent effect of rare and frequent stimuli. We find that responses
to rare stimuli are indeed significantly stronger (SSA
effect) both in the midbrain and forebrain. However, in the
midbrain we report a distinction between the inferior colliculus
(IC) and the optic tectum (OT). Similar to the forebrain,
the OT showed an SSA effect both to changes in frequency
and in interaural time difference (ITD), whereas in
the IC SSA effect emerged only in frequency and not in ITD.
Interestingly, we find that there is a corresponding SSA effect
in response latency in the forebrain and OT, but not in
the IC. In addition we report SSA effects for sound intensities
which can not be explained by synaptic depression. SSA
effects in the intensity domain were absent in IC but clear
in the OT. Our results demonstrate that novelty detection is
an invariant property of the localization pathways of the barn
owl. Different sound properties with diverse neural representations
show similar SSA effects, highlighting the importance
of novelty in the internal representation of sensory information.
The absence of SSA effects in the IC leads us to suggest
that the forebrain circuitry is engaged in novelty detection
and that novelty signals are conveyed from the forebrain to
the midbrain to control behavioral responses in a context dependent
manner.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13066" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NOVEL CONJUGATES OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS

of pain. In the hot plate model (52 &#x000b1; 0.2&#x000b0;C) dose response

the nortriptyline-GABA conjugate BL1021 compared to an
equimolar dose of nortriptyline. Similar results were obtained
with the fluoxetine-GABA conjugate BL1024. In addition,
these conjugates showed more rapid onset and longer
duration of their protective effects against pain as compared
to the parent compounds. Intraplantar injection of formalin
to the paw of Balb/c mice resulted in typical biphasic
flinching behavior of the injected paw. BL1021 and Bl1024
significantly reduced the early neurogenic response and the
late inflammatory peripheral response compared to equimolar
doses of the parent drugs nortriptyline or fluoxetine.
Intraplantar injection of carrageenan to the paws of Wistar
rats was used to assess the anti-inflammatory effects of
BL1021 and BL1024, which were found to be significantly
better in inhibiting the edema than nortriptyline or fluoxetine.
The significantly better efficacy of amides BL1024
and BL1021, compared to their parent compounds towards
both the central perception and the peripheral phase of
pain, makes them promising candidates for the treatment of
acute and chronic pain conditions. The compounds are currently

We have producedmature oligodendrocytes fromhuES
cells, by applying conditions that induce lineage specific transcription
factors Olig1/2, as well as Nkx2.2 and Sox10 which
are needed for maturation. The conditions for huES cell differentiation
included retinoic acid treatment followed by addition
of noggin, an antagonist of bone morphogenetic proteins
(BMPs). We found that retinoic acid induces BMPs in
huES cells and that noggin was essential to obtain the efficient
formation of highly branched mature oligodendrocytes
producing myelin basic protein (MBP). Starting from huES
cells, we derived highly enriched populations of oligodendrocyte
precursors that can be expanded and passaged repeatedly,
and subsequently differentiated into mature cells.
Transplantation of such precursors showed that pretreatment
by noggin markedly stimulates their capacity to myelinate
in the brain of MBP-deficient shiverer mice, in organotypic
cultures, and in living animals. Arrays of numerous
long MBP+ fibers were generated over extended areas in the
brain, with evidence of cell migration after transplantation
and with formation of compactmyelin sheaths. The possibility
to regenerate myelin around axons in the CNS may have
therapeutical applications in congenital myelin deficiencies

was to analyze the effect of the major green tea polyphenol
(-)-epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which has been
shown to possess potent iron chelating properties and radical
scavenging activity, on the expression of iron responsive
APP and the iron metabolism-related protein transferrin

exhibited potent iron chelating activity comparable to that
of the prototype iron chelator desferrioxamine (DFO) and
dose dependently (1&#x02013;10 microM) increased TfR protein and
mRNA levels in human SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells. Both
the immature and full-length cellular holo-APP were significantly
reduced by EGCG, as shown by two-dimensional gel
electrophoresis, without altering APP mRNA levels, suggesting
a posttranscriptional action. Indeed, EGCG suppressed
the translation of a luciferase reporter gene fused to the
APP-5'-mRNA untranslated region, encompassing the APP
iron-responsive element. The finding that Fe2SO4 reversed
EGCG action on APP and TfR proteins reinforces the likelihood
that these effects are mediated through modulation of
the intracellular iron pool. Also, EGCG reduced toxic betaamyloid
peptides generation in CHO cells over-expressing
the APP &#x0201c;Swedish&#x0201d; mutation. Thus, the natural nontoxic

a dose-dependent (EC50 5microM), immediate, and robust

Gly by one carbon was inactive. The effect of PalGly was
not blocked by SR141716A, SR144528, or MK801. Calcium
mobilization was dependent on the presence of extracellular
calcium and blocked by the transient potential (TRP)
channel blocker Ruthenium red (10 microM) but not by
the TRPV1 antagonist 5' iodoresiniferatoxin. PalGly-induced
calcium mobilization was attenuated by the receptor operated

activation of G protein coupled receptors. These receptors,
through specific activation of associated G proteins, directly
and/or indirectly modulate the activity of ion channels and
various transporters. One of the classical examples for such
regulation is the activation of the G-protein-coupled potassium
channels (GIRK) by G proteins. This activation involves
the intimate association of the G-protein with the channels
in concert with other intracellular factors to stabilize the
channel's open conformation. To understand such interactions
it is necessary to develop sensitive means for the detection
of intrinsic subtle motions of the channel molecule during
activation, and of its associated G protein in vivo. This
can be accomplished by using fluorescence resonance energy
transfer (FRET) as a molecular ruler for such motions. One
of the limitations of such an approach is the fact that it is
rather difficult to specifically fluorescently label the cytosolic
face of membrane proteins in situ. To overcome this limitation,
genetically encoded labeling is used in conjunction with
membrane-restricted FRET measurements. An example will
be given using the GIRK channel as a model for a G protein
effector, its intrinsic conformational rearrangements and its
mode of association with G proteins during resting and activated
states will be shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13501" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MOLECULAR LAYER INHIBITION SHAPES THE TIME

molecular layer interneurons (MLI) in the cerebellar cortex
is to limit the time window for synaptic integration and to
ensure a precisely timed spike output of Purkinje cells (PCs)
(Mittmann et al, 2005). Alternatively, Bower suggested that
the absence of mossy fiber (MF) evoked beams of activity is
due to the fast activation of the MLIs (Bower, 2002). Both
suggested functions, however, can only apply to very brief
inputs because of presynaptic inhibition that the MLIs exerts
on each other (Cohen and Yarom, 2000; Mann-Metzer
and Yarom, 2002). We used the voltage-sensitive dye RH-414
to describe the spatio-temporal responses of the cerebellar
cortex to the climbing fiber (CF) and MF inputs and the
effect of the MLI inhibition on these responses in the isolated
cerebellum of a Guinea pig. Surface stimulation elicited
a propagating beam of activity along the Pf axis followed
by lateral inhibition. WM stimulation elicited a variety of
responses. We devised a method to classify these responses
as Cf or Mf responses according to spatio-temporal characteristics.
In short, principal component analysis of the <italic>x</italic>, <italic>y</italic>
coordinates of responding diodes was used to quantify the
elongation and orientation of the response. Parasagitally oriented
responses with long durations were attributed to Cf
activation, and radial responses with short durations were
attributed to Mf activation. Beams of activity, propagating
along the Pf axis, were never encountered in response toWM
stimulation. This was not due to the MLI inhibition as application
of GABAzine prolonged the response without affecting
its spatial distribution. Similarly, prolonged responses
were observed when Mf activation was preceded by inhibition
evoked by surface stimulation. Conversely, Cf responses
were not affected by the preceding inhibition. Thus inhibition
in the cerebellar cortex might serve to increase responsiveness
to prolonged Mf input.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13531" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TEMPORAL SUMMATION IN THE EARLY VISUAL

information processing of neurons, but it remains an unresolved
aspect of the visual system. Previously we reported
that contrast threshold (CT) decreases with increasing presentation
time of a target up to at least 480 ms. This result
suggests a relatively long integration time, which may be considered as a long persistence time of neurons in the primary
visual areas. However, a short integration time (approx
20 ms&#x02013;40ms) of neurons was found when a summation of
2 brief pulses of flashed light was measured. We sought to
test two-pulse summation at the cortical level using smalloriented
Gabor patches (GP, 12 cpd, approx 0.25&#x000b0; diameter).
CT for the target GP, using a two-alternative forcedchoice
paradigm and staircase method, was measured under
conditions of a double pulse of identical stimuli (GPs), and
a pedestal (set to 0.5 or 2 times the subjects CT) and target.
The pedestal was presented in the two intervals before
the target at SOAs of 0ms, 30 ms, 45ms, 60 ms, 75ms, and
90 ms (ISI = 0 (same onset), 0 ms, 15ms, 30 ms, 45ms, and
60 ms, resp). The target and the pedestal had 30 ms durations
each whereas the target was presented only in one interval.
We found that there was a significant decrease in CT with
SOAs of 0ms, 30 ms, and 45 ms. Thus, the summation of the
pedestal with the target decreased when the gap increased between
the presentations, culminating in no effect after an ISI
(gap) of 30ms. To control for the retinal effect, we repeated
the experiment with orthogonal orientations of the pedestal
and target. The results show no effect of summation and the
CT was constant over all SOAs. Since the effect of summation
is orientation-specific, the results indicate that the pulse
summation has a cortical level. Thus, the short duration of
the pulse summation, in contrast to the much longer effect
of integration time, suggests a different time course of temporal
summation for sustained and transient processing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13560" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>POSSIBLE MECHANISM FOR FUNCTIONAL PLASTICITY

following a localized lesion. One possible mechanism for
such plasticity is the recruitment of the unaffected hemisphere.
Studies showed that even extensive lesion of the left
hemisphere, acquired either prenatally or in early childhood,
can result in nearly normal development of language. Functional
imaging in such cases at adulthood demonstrated normal
distribution of language activation in the right hemisphere.
However, it is yet unclear if lesions in the language
dominant hemisphere acquired in adulthood can also result
in a functional recovery. The only way to test this assertion
is by performing consecutive functional brain imaging following
an acquired lesion in adults. Here we present a case
study of patient JT, a 28 years old, right handed male who
was diagnosed with left fronto-temporal low-grade glioma
(lesion size: 44&#x02217;65&#x02217;48 mm). As part of a presurgical assessment
JT underwent an fMRI-based mapping of his language
related areas. The fMRI exam showed left hemispheric dominance,
with lateralization index (LI) = 1 in Broca's area.
Although frontal language activations were in close vicinity
to the lesion, there was no deficit in his language function.
Surgical intervention was not applied at that time. Two
years later there was a 10% increase in the tumor volume yet
with no deficits in language function. Surgical option was reconsidered
and fMRI exam was performed again. In comparison
to the first fMRI exam there was an increased activation
for language in the right hemisphere resulting in altered
LI in the Broca's area to &#x02212;0.93. Interestingly, there was
no such change in posterior language areas. fMRI exams following
surgery showed the same pattern of right hemispheric
dominance with almost no activations in the left hemisphere
(LI = &#x02212;1). This unique case study supports the idea that
interhemispheric functional transfer may underlie potential
functional plasticity in the adult human brain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13661" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IMAGING SODIUM CHANGES IN THE AXONS OF

been mainly studied using electrophysiological recordings.
These studies have used best-frequency maps obtained using
local field potential recordings to draw a gross outline
of the functional architecture of the AC. By exhausting these
best frequency maps throughout the AC, the different functional
subregions of the AC could be identified (A1, AAF,
etc). However, due to technical limitations, the functional
micro-architecture of the AC remains unknown. Recently,
2-photon Laser scanning microscopy (2PLSM) has proven
useful in revealing the micro-architecture of the neocortex
with unprecedented single cell resolution (Ohki et al, Nature,
2005). The aim of the current study has therefore been to reveal
the microarchitecture of the AC using 2PLSM of calcium
signals, and using the house mouse as a model. To this end,
we have combined classical electrophysiology with 2PLSM.
First, using extracellular recordings, we obtained cortical responses
to auditory stimuli in order to identify the AC. Then,
we performed bulk loading of a calcium sensitive dye into the
AC, and imaged the network activity of tens of cells simultaneously
in response to auditory stimuli at single-cell resolution.
By analyzing the change in fluorescence of each cell in
response to broad band noise and to pure tones, we could
determine its response properties, and thus reconstruct the
functional microarchitecture of the network. This experimental
strategy will allow us not only to reveal the functional
microarchitecture of the AC but also to describe its
network dynamics, and eventually set the stage to study its
plasticity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13781" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GALECTIN-3/MAC-2, K-RAS, AND PI3K REGULATE

traumatic injury to axons duringWallerian degeneration,
and for minimizing damage to intact axons and myelin
in multiple sclerosis. Microglia and macrophages remove
degenerated myelin by phagocytosis. We focus presently
on complement receptor-3 (CR3/MAC-1) and scavenger
receptor-AI/II (SRAI/II) mediated myelin phagocytosis in
microglia. Paradoxically, these receptors are expressed in microglia
after injury to CNS axons but myelin is not phagocytosed,
suggesting that phagocytosis is subject to modulation
between efficient and inefficient states. Furthermore,
Galectin-3/MAC-2 is expressed in microglia that phagocytose
but not in microglia that do not phagocytose, thus raising
the possibility that Galectin-3/MAC-2 is instrumental in
regulating phagocytosis. We presently test for the regulatory
roles of Galectin-3/MAC-2, K-RAS, and phosphatidylinositol
3-kinase (PI3K) in myelin phagocytosis. Myelin phagocytosis
was studied in cultured mice microglia. S-trans,transfarnesylthiosalicylic
(FTS), which inhibits Galectin-3/MAC-
2 dependent activation of PI3K through K-RAS-GTP, the active
form of K-RAS, inhibited myelin phagocytosis. K-RASGTP
levels, PI3K activity, and phospho-Akt levels increased
during normal phagocytosis and decreased during phagocytosis
in the presence of FTS. Galectin-3/MAC-2, which binds
and stabilizes K-RAS-GTP that then activates PI3K, coimmunoprecipitated
with RAS, and levels of the coimmunoprecipitate,
increased dramatically during phagocytosis. These
observations suggest, altogether, a role for Galectin-3/MAC-
2 dependent activation of PI3K through K-RAS-GTP in
myelin phagocytosis mediated by CR3/MAC-1 and SRAI/II.
An explanation is offered, thereby, for efficient phagocytosis
by microglia that express CR3/MAC-1 and SRAI/II
along with Gal-3/MAC-2, and for deficient phagocytosis by
microglia that express CR3/MAC-1 and SRAI/II without
Galectin-3/MAC-2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13853" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GALPHA-I3 PRIMES THE G PROTEIN-ACTIVATED K+

inhibitory effects of neurotransmitters in the atrium
and in the brain by coupling to G-protein-coupled receptors
(GPCRs). In neurotransmitter-dependent GIRK signaling,
Gbetagamma is released from the heterotrimeric Galpha-betagamma complex upon GPCR activation, activating
the channel and attenuating its rectification. Today
it becomes clear that Galpha is more than a mere Gbetagamma
donor. We have proposed that Galpha-i-GDP regulates
GIRK gating, keeping its basal activity low but priming
(predisposing) the channel for activation by agonist in intact
cells, and by Gbetagamma in excised patches. Here we
have further investigated GIRK priming by Galpha-i3 using
a paradigm in which the channel was activated by coexpression
of Gbetagamma, and the currents were measured in intact
xenopus oocytes using the two-electrode voltage clamp.
This method enables to bypass the GPCR activation, and to
examine the regulation of GIRK rectification by Galpha, in
intact cells. Using this method, we further characterize the
priming phenomenon. We tested and excluded the possibility
that our estimates of priming are affected by artifacts
caused by series resistance or large K+ fluxes. We demonstrate
that Galpha-i3 reduces the basal channel activity similarly
to a membrane-attached Gbetagamma scavenger protein,
m-phosducin. However, Galpha-i3 allows robust channel
activation by coexpressed Gbetagamma, in sharp contrast
to m-phosducin which causes a substantial reduction in the
total Gbetagamma-induced current. Furthermore, Galpha-i3
also does not impair the Gbetagamma-dependent attenuation
of the channel rectification, in contrast to m-phosducin
which prevents this Gbetagamma-induced modulation. The
G Galpha-i3-induced enhancement of direct activation of
GIRK by Gbetagamma, demonstrated here for the first time
in intact cells, strongly supports the hypothesis that Galpha-i
regulates GIRK gating under physiological conditions.</p><p>

property underlying many biological phenomena.
The flow of information between distal elements of a protein
may rely on allosteric communication networks along
the protein's tertiary or quaternary structure. To unravel the
underlying features of energy parsing along allosteric pathways
recently detected in voltage-gated K+ channels, highorder
thermodynamic coupling analysis was performed. We
report that such allosteric trajectories are functionally conserved
and delineated by sharply defined boundaries. Moreover,
allosteric trajectories assume a hierarchical organization
whereby increasingly stronger layers of cooperative
residue interactions act to ensure efficient and cooperative
long-range coupling between distal channel regions. This
long-range communication is brought about by a coupling of
local and global conformational changes suggesting that the
allosteric trajectory also corresponds to a pathway of physical
deformation. These trajectory features may be a general
property of allosterically regulated proteins and might explain
how the lower activation and upper inactivation pore
gates of voltage-activated K+ channels communicate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13990" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DYNAMIC GAIN CONTROL IS AN INTRINSIC PROPERTY

In this work we investigate the mechanisms underlying the adaptive behavior of a motion-sensitive neuron of the fly
visual system, H1. This neuron has been shown to rapidly
adapt its velocity response gain to the dynamic range of stimulus
velocity fluctuations. We ask two questions. (1) Which
parameters of the motion detection systemin the fly adapt to
stimulus statistics? (2) Does the observed velocity gain control
result from adaptation of the parameters of the motion
detection system, or is it an automatic result of the nonlinearity
of the system, as previously suggested (Borst et al,
2005)? To address these questions, we model H1 as an array
of Reichardtmotion detectors, consisting of a high-pass filter
(HPF), a low-pass filter (LPF), amultiplier, and a subtraction
stage, followed by a static nonlinearity. The parameters of the
model are fit to spike trains recorded from H1 while flies were
stimulated by amoving grating with a low-pass filtered white
noise velocity profile with various velocity fluctuation amplitudes.
In order to determine which, if any, of the parameters
of the system change with the stimulus statistics, we calculate
the optimal parameters for each stimulus condition. We find
that the shape of the static nonlinearity is weakly dependent
on stimulus amplitude. The strongest dependence is exhibited
by the HPF time constant, which shortens considerably
with increasing velocity fluctuations. However, adaptation of
the velocity response gain to the amplitude of velocity fluctuations
turns out to be largely independent of these parameter
changes. This is shown by comparing the above model
to a motion detector with fixed optimal parameters, which
exhibits similar gain control. We conclude that the dynamic
gain control exhibited by H1 arises from the intrinsic properties
of the underlying motion detector, independent of parameter
change.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14061" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MODELING A L4-TO-L2/3MODULE OF

of a neocortical column, focusing on the synaptic connection
between layer 4 (L4) spiny neurons and layer 2/3 (L2/3)
pyramidal cells in rat barrel cortex. It is based firstly on a
detailed morphological and functional characterization of
synaptically-connected pairs of L4-L2/3 neurons from in
vitro recordings and secondly on in vivo recordings of voltage
responses of L2/3 pyramids to current steps as well as
on their response evoked by a whisker deflection. In vitro
data, combined with a detailed compartmental model of
L2/3 cells, enable us to extract their specific passive properties
and spatial distribution of L4-L2/3 synaptic contacts.
The specific membrane resistivity and capacitance of L2/3
cells are around 16,000 ohmcm2 and 0.8microF/cm2, respectively,
and the peak conductance per L4 synaptic contact
is 0.1nS&#x02013;0.48nS for AMPA receptors and around 0.2nS
for NMDA&#x02014;receptors. The in vivo voltage response for current
steps were then used to calibrate the L2/3 compartmental
model for in vivo conditions in the DOWN state. Consequently,
the effect of a single whisker deflection on the voltage
response of an L2/3 pyramidal cell was modeled by activating
a population of, on average, 350 L4 axons (1,575
synaptic contacts) converging onto the modeled L2/3 cell.
Based on conductance values per synaptic contact, their spatial
distribution on L2/3 dendrites and the in vivo firing
probability of L4 spiny neurons, the model predicts that the
feed-forward L4-L2/3 connection, on its own assuming no
correlation between the firing of the presynaptic L4 cells,
cannot fire the L2/3 pyramidal cell. Possible elaboration of
the model will be presented.</p><p>

a cognitive decline. Although defined as a natural condition,
many pathological neurodegenerative processes are involved
in aging, manifested by reduced memory, executive function,
motor abilities, and processing speed. The main hypothesis
of this research is that age-related cognitive decline is a
complex, not specific and multiregional process without repeated
pattern across subjects. In the present research we
used Q space imaging (QSI), which is a noninvasive, highly
sensitive MRI method for detection of brain changes. QSI
was performed in brains of 50 subjects, age 25&#x02013;82 y. Subjects
also underwent a series of neuropsychological tests outside
the scanner (including memory performance, executive
function, motor abilities, visual-spatial, and verbal function).
The subjects' test performance as well as subject's age served
as covariate correlation inputs for voxel-based morphometry
(VBM) of MRI scans. Region of interest (ROI) analysis
was performed based on the VBM results and the correlation
coefficient was extracted for each test in each ROI. The results showed that age is highly correlated with QSI indices
in all ROIs, while the correlation of cognitive performance
with QSI indices in each ROI was task specific. For example,
in the right thalamus, the correlation coefficient with
memory was <italic>r</italic> = 0.46, while in other tasks (motor, visual
spatial, and verbal tasks) a correlation coefficient smaller
than 0.35 (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003c; 0.35) was found. An exception was the stroop
interference task, which showed a high correlation in all
ROIs, implying that it is a nonspecific multiregional task.
In conclusion, although brain changes with age are multiregional,
the cognitive abilities of subjects show region specific
brain changes, which allow a more focused observation of
the heterogeneous aging process.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14198" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LEARNING AND THE PRESYNAPSE: LACK OF THE

screen for presynaptic proteins (Reichmuth et al 1995,
Brain Res Mol Brain Res; Funk et al 2004, BMC Neurosci).
It is a member to a novel, phylogenetically conserved, gene
family. Here we take the first step to understand its function.
In Drosophila, the SAP47 protein is encoded by one
single gene for which a deletion mutant (Sap47156) is available,
suffering a 2.1 kb deletion in the regulatory region and
the first exon of the gene. We outcrossed this mutant strain
to wild-type (WT) for nine generations to achieve isogenic
background. These strains, after describing the expression
pattern of SAP47 in wild-type larvae and showing the absence
of protein in Sap47156 mutants, were tested in an associative
learning task in larval fruit flies. For this task, larvae
are trained to associate an odour with a food reward.
We report that Sap47156 mutants show reduced learning
when compared to wild-type (WT). Sensory ability with respect
to detection of the to-be-associated stimuli and motor
performance, however, was normal in these mutants.
This underscores that presynaptic function in invertebrates
is critical for learning. We now pursue an RNAi approach
to test where in the brain SAP47 function is necessary for
learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14239" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TEMPORAL INACTIVATION, BUT NOT LESION,

in dorsal and ventral striatum that may relate to the actor

(O'Doherty et al, 2004). The aim of the present
study was to determine whether instrumental conditioning
critically depends on activation of the striatum. We used a
task in which approx 50% of normal subjects fail to learn.
We hypothesized that regions playing a critical role in instrumental
conditioning should be more engaged in those
subjects who succeed in learning the task (learners) than
in those who fail to learn the task (nonlearners). 30 subjects
(1 discarded) were scanned with fMRI while undergoing
the task. Subjects' decisions were modeled using a
temporal-difference (TD) algorithm to generate prediction
error (PE) signals for each subject and then regressed against
each subjects' fMRI data. Comparisons were conducted to
determine areas showing enhanced correlations with PE signals
in learners than nonlearners. 17 subjects met the learning
criterion and were categorized as learners; 12 categorized
as nonlearners. Consistent with our hypothesis, significant
correlations with PE signals were found in both the dorsal
and ventral striatum in learners at P &#x0003c; .001. In contrast,
only ventral striatum activity was observed in nonlearners,
at a lower significance level (P &#x0003c; .05). Furthermore, a direct
comparison between the two groups revealed that the dorsal
striatum was significantly better correlated with PE signals in learners than in nonlearners. We found that neural activity
in dorsal striatum is significantly better correlated with
prediction error signals in learners compared to nonlearners.
These results are suggestive of a causal relationship between
prediction error signals in dorsal striatum activity and
learning efficacy. These signals may be generated by afferent

We demonstrate that the CHI-induced increase in the expression

restored the expressions of these subunits to their normal

oxygen species (ROS) production. Disruption of cell
oxidative balance leads to activation of inflammatory and
apoptotic pathways. The brain tissue is highly susceptible
to oxidative stress due to its high metabolic rate, high contents
of PUFA and lack of repair and defense mechanisms.
Melatonin and its active metabolite N1-acetyl-N2-formyl-5-
methoxykynuramine (AFMK) are potent antioxidants, and
previous studies have shown their effectiveness in various inflammatory
and apoptotic models. Nuclear Factor-kappa-B
is a redox-sensitive transcription factor involved in inflammatory
processes (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta). Its activation involves
phosphorylation of the Inhibitory-kappa-B molecule.
Akt-1 phosphorylation has been shown to play a role in neuroprotection
via deactivation of pro-apoptotoc molecules
(Bad, Bax) and augmentation of antiapoptotic ones (BclXL).
This study examined the effect of AFMK on neurological
outcome, gene expression, and protein activation of ROSrelated
pathways.Three groups of male Sabramicewere used
in this study&#x02014;vehicle, melatonin, and AFMK injected. Mice
were subjected to CHI induced by a weight drop device or
sham surgery. Motor function was measured 1 hour after
injury and on given timepoints. Akt-1 and I-kappa-B levels
were measured by Western Blotting. Bad, Bax, BclXL, IL-
1beta. IL-10 and TNF-alpha levels were measured by realtime
RT-PCR. AFMK improved motor function after injury
and increased Akt-1 phosphorylation. Its effect on I-kappa-
B phosphorylation was less pronounced, yet it kept its activation
on the basal level (similar to sham group). AFMK
also enhanced the expression of BclXL and IL-10 while reducing
the expressions of Bad, Bax, IL-10, and TNF-alpha.
These finding suggest that AFMK exerts a neuroprotective
effect by acting on keymolecules in apoptotic and inflammatory
pathways affected by ROS, shifting the balance towards
more protective cellular pathways.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14583" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NICOTINIC ACETYLCHOLINE RECEPTOR (nAChR)

and without nAChR modulators and body temperature was
measured continuously at 30 minutes intervals. Behavioral
responses were assessed in the MWM and EPM 30 minutes
after the first and third injections. Frontal cortex (FC) and
hippocampal subregions were isolated. When nicotine was
repeatedly injected for three consecutive days, the decrease in
body temperature was progressively significantly smaller, indicating
desensitization of the nAChR. When nAChR modulators
were injected together with nicotine on the second and
third days, the progressive attenuation was significantly less
marked, and the drop in body temperature was significantly
greater after the second and the third injections than in the
nicotine-treated control group. Concomitantly, animals receiving
the nAChR modulator with nicotine demonstrated
significantly more rapid learning in the MWM, lower anxiety
response on the EPM, and significantly increased levels
of BDNF mRNA in the FC, than in the nicotine only and
untreated controls. Modulators of the nAChR may circumvent
the problem of nicotine-induced desensitization, delaying
the development of tolerance to nicotine and significantly
extend the period of efficacy of long-term administration of
nicotine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14633" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HIGH-RESOLUTION REPRESENTATION OF LEFT AND

is unclear. While behavioral evidence suggests that the human
auditory system is sensitive to azimuthal differences of
less than 10 deg, neurons in the auditory cortex of cats and
monkeys show broad receptive fields. We measured the neural
correlate ofhuman spatial changedetection in 17 subjects,
using the mismatch negativity (MMN) event related potential,
a marker of preattentive auditory processing with major
sources at the auditory cortex. We assessed both the electrophysiological
and the behavioral change detection measures
for 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, and 60 deg of deviation of sound location
from the standard location, comparing the left and
right hemispaces, as well as the direction of deviation (towards
or away from the midline). The MMN was measured
in an unattended session, while during the attended session
we asked the subjects to detect auditory spatial changes. The MMN response displayed a double peak, more evident
in the case where the standard was closer to the midline. Both
peaks showed a significant effect of deviance, with a near
linear relationship between the magnitude of spatial change
and the MMN amplitude throughout the range. In contrast,
speed and accuracy of performance improved up to 30 deg
and then reached a plateau. There was a significant interaction
between the direction of deviation and deviation magnitude
for the early peak, with a steeper slope for the case in
which the standard was lateral and the deviation was towards
the midline. No difference was found between deviations on
the left and on the right for either MMN peak. We conclude
that the positions of auditory events are accurately tracked at
the level of the auditory cortex, with no indication of hemispace
differences.</p><p>

and has been extensively studied in rodents to reveal its neuroendocrine
basis and how it impairs offspring development.
However, similar assumptions about women abused before
pregnancy, for example, in childhood, adulthood, or by rape,
have not been investigated experimentally. Here, in rats, we
investigated the effects of 7 days of unpredictable variable
stress 2 weeks before mating (modeling adult stress), and immediately
before mating (modeling stress before conception)
on offspring behavior of 18 female SD rats. 6 females were
mated 2 weeks after stress (group A), 7 females were mated
immediately after the stress (group B), and 5 control females
were left undisturbed until mating. All females were introduced
to the males on the same day. Conception rates did
not differ, group A 3 from 6, group B 5 from 7, and controls
3 from 5. When tested 2 months old in the open field, group
A female offspring were most anxious and spent less time in
the central space than group B or controls (<italic>n</italic> equals 11, 15,

avoided shock more, and escaped shock less than controls

in regard to the nature of the neural code. While some studies highlight the role of a distributed population code,
others emphasize the possibility of a &#x0201c;single best cell&#x0201d; readout.
One particularly interesting example of &#x0201c;single best cell&#x0201d;
readout is provided by the &#x0201c;Winner Takes All&#x0201d; (WTA) approach.
According to the WTA, every cell is characterized
by one particular preferred stimulus, to which it responds
maximally. The WTA estimate for the stimulus is defined
as the preferred stimulus of the cell with the strongest response.
From a theoretical point of view, not much is known
about efficiency of &#x0201c;single best cell&#x0201d; readout mechanisms,
in contrast to the considerable existing theoretical knowledge
on the efficiency of distributed population codes. In
this work, we provide a basic theoretical framework for investigating
single best cell readout mechanisms. We study
the accuracy of the WTA readout. In particular, we are interested
in how the WTA accuracy scales with the number
of cells in the population. Using this framework, we
show that, for large neuronal populations, the WTA accuracy
is dominated by the tail of the single-cell response
distribution. Furthermore, we find that although the WTA
accuracy does improve when larger populations are considered,
this improvement is extremely weak compared to
other types of population codes. More precisely, we show
that while the accuracy of a linear readout scales linearly
with the population size, the accuracy of the WTA readout
scales logarithmically with the number of cells in the
population.</p><p>

as a potent in vivo regulator of neurodegenerative disorders
and depression. We developed a selective competitive
cell-permeable peptide inhibitor of GSK-3, L803-mts, and
used it as a novel tool in evaluating its biological activity
in various cell systems. In previous work we demonstrated
that L803-mts provoked antidepressive-like activity
in the animal model of depression, the mouse forced swimming
test (FST). In the current study we investigated how
GSK-3 is regulated by mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI),
and whether or not its inhibition affects depressive behavior
induced by this insult. Experiments performed in the
closed brain-injury weight-drop model showed that hippocampus
GSK-3bta was rapidly inhibited by mTBI. This
was associated with activation of PKB, and accumulation
of GSK-3-downstream target beta-catenin that was mainly
detected in the dentate gyrus and CA3. mTBI produced a
rapid depressive-like behavior 24 h post injury, however,
treatment with L803-mts (i.c.v. injection), significantly reduced
immobility, in fact, L803-mts prevented depression
in mTBI-animals. We conclude that mTBI elicits an early
&#x0201c;prosurvival&#x0201d; cascade of PKB/GSK-3beta/beta-catenin that
likely supports neuroprotection. We suggest that GSK-3 inhibitors
may present a new tool in the treatment of the adverse

characterized by hyperalgesia, allodynia, and spontaneous
ectopic discharge. Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pain facilitatory
role in baseline pain sensitivity, as well as in various
inflammatory conditions. We tested the hypothesis that impaired
IL-1-signaling influences neuropathic pain, using two
mousemodels: mice with targeted deletion of the IL-1 receptor
type I (IL-1rKO), and mice with transgenic overexpression
of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1raTG), and their
wild-type (WT) controls. Neuropathy was induced by cutting
the L5 spinal nerve on one side (Chung's procedure),
and mechanosensitivity was assessed for 7 successive days.
WT mice developed neuropathic pain, as reflected by significant
allodynia in the hindpaw ipsilateral to the injury. The
mutant strains, however, did not display increased pain sensitivity
in either hindpaw. Spontaneous ectopic neuronal activity
of these strains was recorded in the dorsal root ganglion
(DRG), 1, 3, and 7 days following nerve injury. In
WT mice a significant proportion of the axons exhibited
spontaneous ectopic neuronal activity, whereas in mutant
mice only a minimal number of axons exhibited such activity.
We also tested the effect of pharmacological blockade
of IL-1 signaling, by chronic infusion of interleukin-
1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) in control adult mice, using
subcutaneously osmotic micropumps, implanted two
days prior to Chung's procedure. Saline-treated mice developed
neuropathic pain, whereas the IL-1ra-treated mice
did not display increased pain sensitivity. Correspondingly,
in saline-treated mice a significant proportion of the axons
exhibited spontaneous discharge, whereas in IL-1ra-treated
mice only a minimal number of axons exhibited such activity.
Taken together, these results indicate that IL-1 signaling
plays an important role in the post-injury altered neuronal
activity that underlies the development of neuropathic
pain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15031" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DIFFERENTIAL NEUROPROTECTIVE

with erythropoietin (rhEpo) are established neuroprotective
paradigms in a mouse model of closed head injury (CHI).
HA-induced neuroprotection includes a reduction in cerebral
edema and involves increased erythropoietin receptor
(EpoR) expression, suggesting that endogenous Epo may be
involved in reducing post-CHI tissue water accumulation
and that the beneficial effects of HA possibly will be augmented
by post-CHI rhEpo (exogenous Epo). Here we examined
the effects of endogenous and exogenous Epo on
cerebral edema and assessed the effects of supplemental exogenous
Epo treatment on neuroprotective outcomes in HA
animals. CHI was induced using a weight drop device. Tissue
water content was measured at 24 hours post-CHI in
brain segments taken from mice treated with either rhEpo
or an anti-Epo antibody and appropriate controls. The efficacy
of combining exogenous Epo treatment and HA was
examined by subjecting HA and control (NT) mice to an object
recognition test (ORT) as well as comparing the extent
of neuronal degeneration by Fluoro-Jade B staining. Treatment
with anti-Epo led to increased edema formation while
exogenous Epo induced no beneficial effect on this outcome
measure. ORT analysis and immunohistochemical findings
reinforced HA and rhEpo as individual protective interventions
but showed no advantage to combining the two strategies.
In conclusion, the reduction of edema formation requires
endogenous Epo but is unaffected by exogenous administration
of this agent. Similarly, while increased expression
of EpoR has been shown to be involved in HA-induced
neuroprotection, additional supplementation of Epo does
not lead to a further enhancement of the effect. HA-induced
neuroprotection may therefore be comparable to certain features
of CHI pathophysiology which are affected by preexisting
neuroprotective mediators but cannot be further augmented
by treatment aimed at increasing the levels of these
agents.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15138" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INVOLVEMENT OF NOVEL GROWTH FACTORS IN

abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein.
This pathology is generally accompanied by microtubule
(MT) instability that finally results in degeneration of neurons.
Inhibition of tau abnormality and recovery of MT
structure are among the most promising therapeutic approaches
to Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies. NAP
is a short neuroprotective peptide derived from activitydependent
neuroprotective protein (Bassan et al [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]; Gozes
et al [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). Earlier studies in our laboratory showed that NAP
can directly interact with tubulin, a subunit of MT, causing
MT reorganization and an increase in nonphosphorylated
tau (Divinski et al [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; Gozes and Divinski [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]). The
current research analyzed whether NAP could provide neuroprotection
in cases of an in vivo pathology. We used a
tau-transgenic (Tg) mouse model that expresses a human
double mutant tau protein in the central nervous system.
Daily treatment (5 days a week) of both wild type (wt) and
Tg mice with intranasal NAP for a period of approximately
5 months significantly reduced anxiety-like behavior in the
Tg male mice, with only a slight, nonsignificant decrease in
the wt group. The same specific NAP effect on the Tg mice
was demonstrated by the probe test during a Morris Water
Maze (MWM) task, which assesses spatial short-term learning
and memory. Eleven-month-old Tg animals exhibited
learning and memory impairments in the MWM, as compared
to the controls. This pathology was significantly improved
by chronic NAP administration for 9 months. Furthermore,
daily treatment with NAP resulted in improved
short-termmemory in wtmice. Our results suggest that NAP
is a promising drug candidate in ameliorating cognitive dysfunctions,
associated with tau pathology and aging processes.</p><p>

no evidence of neuronal loss, frequent histories of stressful
experiences and increased risk to develop post-traumatic
stress disorder (PTSD). This suggested that chronic, stressinduced
alterations in hippocampal gene expression may
be causally involved. We have recently shown that chronic
over-expression of the readthrough splice variant of acetylcholinesterase,
AChE-R, accentuates long-term potentiation
in murine hippocampus. Therefore, we explored the appearance
of seizures in TgR transgenic mice over-expressing human
AChE-R. Up to 8 months of age, TgR mice kept under
regular laboratory conditions presented no seizures. However,
30% of &#x0003e; 14 months old female, but not male TgR
mice not subjected to any stress paradigms began to display
seizures. This was accompanied by variably declined
density of neuropeptide Y (NPY)-positive axonal profiles
in the hippocampal stratum lacunosum moleculare (SLM)
and outer molecular layer of the dentate gyrus. NPY is
known to moderate stress reactions and seizures. Intriguingly,
NPY reductions are associated inversely with the severity
of stress-associated symptoms, ranging from no behavioral
alterations, to stereotypic behavior and to spontaneous
seizures for mice presenting 45%, 70%, and 90% reduction
in SLM NPY, respectively. In mice with seizures, NPY innervation
of the mossy fiber terminal region was increased,
supporting reports of others that this is a reaction rather
than a cause of seizures. Our findings demonstrate genderassociated
interactions of chronically over-expressed AChER
with NPY neurotransmission, and suggest that such interactions
cause a range of stress-related effects culminating
with genesis of seizures.</p><p>

lobes play an important role in the learning neural circuitry
of cephalopods. In Octopus vulgaris we discovered LTP at
the MSF to VL connection. Here we &#x0201c;short-circuit&#x0201d; this connection
by inducing a global LTP, or &#x0201c;disconnect&#x0201d; it by severing
the MSF to VL tract. Octopuses were pretrained to
attack a white ball. Animals were anesthetized in seawater
with 55mM MgCl2 and 1% ethanol (that does not block
LTP induction). Five sites in the exposed MSF-VL area were
tetanized (4 &#x000d7; 33 Hz 1 s). This reduced the level of LTP that
could be induced in brains isolated afterwards. &#x0201c;Disconnection&#x0201d;
was achieved by severing the tract between the MSF
to VL. After 90 min of recovery, the animals were trained to
avoid attacking a red ball by negative reinforcement (12Vac).
Four consecutive &#x0201c;no-touch&#x0201d; was set as a learning criterion.
Although there was no difference in the number of trials to
reach criterion (tetanized: 4.2 &#x000b1; 0.7, <italic>n</italic> = 14, sham: 5.6 &#x000b1; 1,
<italic>n</italic> = 15; <italic>P</italic> = .2, <italic>t</italic>-test), the tetanized animals learned
faster, performing less touches by the 4th trail (<italic>P</italic> = .02,
chi square). &#x0201c;Disconnected&#x0201d; animals required more trials
than the sham to reach criterion (10.1 &#x000b1; 1, <italic>n</italic> = 12, versus
4.8 &#x000b1; 0.8, <italic>n</italic> = 9, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001, <italic>t</italic>-test). Memory recall was
tested the following day. While there was no difference between
groups in the number of &#x0201c;no-touch&#x0201d; in the first testing
trial (<italic>P</italic> = .65 chi square), it was significantly higher in
sham than in tetanized animals at the third trial (10 of 15
versus 4 of 14; <italic>P</italic> = .04, chi square). &#x0201c;Disconnected&#x0201d; animals
did not show significant memory recall as 8 out of the 12
octopuses made errors in all 5 test trials in contrast to only
1 out of the 9 sham (<italic>P</italic> = .015, chi square). These results
suggest that while the VL modulates the rate of short-term
avoidance learning that takes place outside of the VL, the VL
is a crucial site for the establishment of long-term memory

downstream of BMP4. Furthermore, N-cadherin protein,

stem cell &#x0201c;niche.&#x0201d; In mammals, the identity of these specialized
cells is largely unknown. The Sertoli cells of the
testis represent a known example of an identified niche cell.
Though poorly understood, Sertoli cells exert control over
proliferation and differentiation of the stem cell population
of the testis, the spermatagonia. To test if Sertoli cells can
act as surrogate niche cells for other stem cell populations,
cocultures of postnatal Sertoli cells and embryonic neural
progenitor cells (NPCs) were produced and monitored for
reciprocal communication. The neural progenitor cells were
transfected with GFP prior to establishing the cultures. Immunofluorescence
was performed to assess differentiation of
the progenitor cells. The Sertoli and NPCs in a parallel set of
cultures were separated by FACS and seeded in 96 well plates
and subjected to an ELISA for the trophic factor GDNF. This
factor originally discovered in glial cells in the CNS is also
produced by Sertoli cells, and promotes proliferation in spermatagonia.
NPCs exposed to Sertoli cells over 4 days exhibited
increased differentiation into neurons and glia, compared
with NPC-derived neurospheres maintained in culture
alone. A potential mechanism for this observation was obtained
in the Elisa assay carried out on the cultures. The concentration
of GDNF in the NPCs alone was determined to be
more than 700 pg/mg protein, which dropped to 150 pg/mg
in the NPCs cocultured for 4 days with Sertoli cells. This indicates
that the Sertoli cells inhibited GDNF production in
the NPCs. Since GDNF promotes proliferation of progenitor
cells in the testis, this effect could induce differentiation
in the NPCs. Current efforts are underway to identify the
Sertoli signals mediating the reduction in GDNF produced
in the neurospheres and NPC-derived signals to Sertoli
cells.</p><p>

uncovering neural pathways mediating the interhemispheric

results support a study reporting right-lateralized brain activations

for superiority of LVF presentation in processing emotional
facial expressions, our findings also point to dominance of

In order to investigate how rats explore their environment
using their whiskers, an artificial whisking can be used in which the facial motor nerve is electrically stimulated.
The stimulation that induces whisker protraction consists
of a bipolar pulse train of specific frequency and amplitude,
which propagates through the motor nerve fibers
to activate the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles which control
whisker position. The aim of this study is to model the
whisker trajectory as a function of the principal stimulus
parameters: instantaneous frequency and pulse amplitude.
Thus, nerve conduction, muscle activation, muscle-follicle
interaction, and follicle-whisker interaction are included in
the &#x0201c;muscle-follicle system&#x0201d; whose transfer function is to be
deciphered. First, we studied the impulse response of this system
by measuring whisker trajectory due to single electrical
bipolar pulse. If the system is linear, a convolution of the impulse
response with the actual stimulus train should generate
the response to the train. We tested this prediction and
found that the system is not linear&#x02014;a facilitatory nonlinear
component, which stands for a nonlinear interaction between
successive pulses, must be added. The nonlinear interaction
can be accounted by several processes, among which
are neuro-muscular facilitation and muscle-follicle dynamics.
We are currently assessing the plausibility of each of these
mechanisms. The transfer function between the motor nerve
and whisker trajectory is the first step in reverse engineering
vibrissal loops. It will be used to generate behaviorallymeasured
trajectories in anesthetized animals, and to generate
&#x0201c;white noise&#x0201d; stimuli which will facilitate characterization
of neuronal transfer functions along the various
loops.</p><p>

(20&#x02013;30 Hz) and gamma oscillations (60&#x02013;100 Hz) were
observed in mice performing odor discrimination tasks. In
one task the oscillations evolved, as the animal learned the
task, from low to high powered gamma oscillations. In another
task the oscillations evolved to beta oscillations. Here,
we investigate the underlying mechanisms that produce these
oscillations and the changes in the network that enables the
transition from one oscillation type to another. High power
gamma oscillations were shown to be generated by the local
circuitry of the dendro-dendritic synapses between the mitral
cells (MC) and the granule cells (MC) in the OB. These
oscillations are maintained when the GC dendrites are separated
from their cell body. We have built a detailed model of
both the MCs and the dendrites of the GCs and were able to
produce these high power gamma oscillations. We hypothesize
that the low power gamma oscillations are generated
when nonsynchronized input from the pyriform cortex (PC)
arrives to the OB. We show that the source of this nonsynchronized
input may be the OB itself: the MCs in the OB
excite the pyramidal cells in the PC that, in turn, excite the
GCs back in the OB. We show that the wide range of delays
seen in this excitation loop (15 ms&#x02013;35ms) is enough to generate
such nonsynchronized input and consequently, the low
powered gamma oscillations. Beta oscillations were shown to
require the existence of the excitation loop between the OB
and the PC; that is, both input from the MCs onto the pyramidal
cells in the PC and input from the PC onto the GCs
are required. We hypothesize that during the learning of the
task, in which beta appears, a subset of the synapses, with a
lower range of delays, is strengthene to produce the beta oscillations.</p><p>

of the central nerve system (CNS), the peripheral nerve
system (PNS) has received relatively little attention, at least
partly, due to susceptibility induced artifacts and the small
volume of the nerves. The main problem facing PNS imaging
is rooted in the narrow structure of the limbs, resulting
in a large boundary layer. Therefore the problem of susceptibility
induced artifacts, appearing due to the passage of the
magnetic field through the different mediums and distorting
almost all the relevant data, was the first to overcome. In
this study we have used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to
obtain images of the median and ulnar forearm's nerves in
18 healthy subjects and 8 patients suffering from the carpal
tunnel syndrome (CTS). We used DTI to extract the fractional
anisotropy (FA), and the apparent diffusion coefficient
(ADC) values of the median nerve proximally to, and within,
the wrist's carpal tunnel (CT). We found that, for healthy
subjects, at the CT FA values are elevated while the ADC
values are significantly reduced. The CTS subjects showed
the opposite trend with significantly lower FA at the CT indicating
progressive edema of the nerve. With the use of a
high-field magnet, a stronger gradient system and technical
devices to reduce susceptibility artifacts, imaging of peripheral
nerves using DTI is now feasible. Using the protocol described
above the median and ulnar nerves can be well quantified
and characterized using DTI for healthy and CTS subjects
giving clear cut differentiation between the two groups.
This could have tremendous effects for studying many related
forearm nerve pathologies, as the carpal tunnel syndrome, as
well as being the beginning of a vast study and assessment of
the rest of the PNS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15970" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>COMPLEX NEURAL PROCESSING IN BACKWARD

processing. When a &#x000fd; mask is presented, 100 ms after
the target (backward masking), the target's visibility is &#x000fd; reduced.
We developed a new visual evoked potentials (VEP)
paradigm for exploring the &#x000fd; neural processing involved in
backward masking (BM) in the human visual cortex. The &#x000fd;
mask (M) was composed of two collinear high-contrast Gabor
patches (GPs), spatially &#x000fd; separated from the target location
(T, low-contrast GP). The mask was presented at &#x000fd; different
ISIs after (1) T alone (BM-on-T) or (2) T + 2 flanking
GPs (LM, BM-on-LM). The waveforms of the elicited
responses for the various BM combinations and their amplitudes
were compared within time-windows defined by the
waveforms of the control responses of T, LM, and M stimuli
at different ISIs. The amount of correlation between the
waveforms and/or their amplitude modulation was regarded
as BM effect. In both conditions, at the ISI = 50 ms the T
response was not suppressed due to the integration (fusion)
in the time domain of the responses elicited by T and M. In
BM-on-T, a negative sign of the LM was suppressed up to
ISI = 200 ms. However, while the M response in the BMon-
T condition remained unchanged, it was strongly suppressed
in BM-on-LM at the ISI = 100 ms and recovered
at the ISI = 200 ms. Thus, the results suggest that BM effect
reflects complex neural processing of temporal order and
saliency of each of the components. Remarkably, it was also relevant in which modality the recalled
objects were originally recognized in the memory
tasks. Recall of the list of haptically recognized objects elicited
greater activation than its auditory parallel in the occipital
lobe of the blind. More evidence for the importance of encoding
modality was found in &#x0201c;memory traces&#x0201d; in the relevant
sensory (somatosensory or auditory) cortex. These results
demonstrate the relevance of the original sensory encoding
source to the cortical patterns of activation during recall
in the congenitally blind.</p><p>

loss of control over drug consumption. The neurobiology of
addiction is traditionally thought to involve the reward system
of the brain. This system comprises DA neurons with
cell bodies in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) of the midbrain
and projection areas of these neurons in the limbic
forebrain and in particular the nucleus accumbens (NAC).
However, the hippocampus has received renewed interest for
its potential role in addiction. Part of this attention is due
to the fact that drugs of abuse are potent negative regulators
of the neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus. We investigated
the effect of chronic cocaine self-administration
on neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus.
Rats (300&#x02013;320 gr) were trained to self-administer cocaine
(1.5mg/kg) using the FR1 paradigm. After reaching maintenance,
rats were injected with 5-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU).
28 days later they were euthanized and their brains stained
with antibodies to BrdU and the mature neuronal marker
NeuN. Significantly less newly formed neurons (double positive
for BrdU and NeuN) were found in the dentate gyrus
of rats that self administrated cocaine. These results suggest

disease and it is often refractory to analgesic therapy. It is
characterized in humans by spontaneous pain and abnormal
evoked pain such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Neuropathic
pain is thought to result from nerve injury-triggered
pathophysiological changes in both the peripheral and the
central nervous systems. The details, however, are uncertain.
In addition to its clinical significance, neuropathic pain is
important from a basic scientific point of view because of
the fundamental paradox that it poses. Blockade of nerve
conduction due to injury ought to reduce sensation, causing
hypoesthesia. Why, then, is there frequently amplification
of sensation, with hyperesthesia and ongoing pain? Both
the clinical imperative and the scientific mystery are subjects
of this symposium. Elon Eisenberg will address the prevalence,
clinical manifestations, and treatments of chronic pain
in general, and some key neuropathic pain states in particular.
James Campbell will address the issue of pain-control in
the spinal cord. Adjustment of excitatory mechanisms, &#x0201c;central
sensitization,&#x0201d; can cause normally innocuous stimuli to
be felt as painful. Specific types of peripheral neuronal input
are associated with nerve injury trigger andmaintain this
&#x0201c;central sensitization.&#x0201d; Marshall Devor will consider the regulation
of neuronal excitability in the pain system, and how
genetic polymorphisms can lead to individual differences in
pain susceptibility. Finally, Yehuda (Udi) Shavit will discuss
the role of cytokines in neuropathic pain. Data from animals
with genetically impaired IL-1 signaling indicate that this cytokine
plays an intimate role in the altered neuronal activity
that underlies the development of neuropathic pain following
nerve injury. The symposium will shed light on the
neural mechanisms that underlie neuropathic pain and that
cause so much suffering in the clinical setting.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16176" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>STATE-DEPENDENT SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY IN

that the cerebellum stores memory traces at the parallel fibers
(pf) synapse. According to this theory, the climbing fibers
(cf) control the learning process by inducing long-term depression
(LTD) of the simultaneously activated pf synapses.
In a recent study we showed that Purkinje cells (PCs), under
in vivo conditions, display bistability of their membrane
potential. The bistability is an intrinsic property of the neurons,
such that the membrane potential can remain either
in a hyperpolarizing quiescent state (&#x0201c;down&#x0201d; state) or in a depolarizing active state (&#x0201c;up&#x0201d; state). In the current study
we examined to what extent the bistability of PCs in a slice
preparation affects plastic processes. To that end, we paired
local application of glutamate with the state of the PCs. At
the end of this pairing procedure, we measured the voltage
response induced by a pulse of glutamate and compared it to
the control measurement. We found that 20 pairs at repetition
rate of 1Hz was sufficient to induce a robust long term
depression (LTD) in the response to glutamate applications.
We concluded that the up state of the PCs membrane potential
could produce LTD. Furthermore, the fact that LTD can
be induced by the up state can account for the loose temporal
relationship between the pf and the cf that has been reported
in the literature.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16227" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE ROLE OF BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC

BDNF levels, especially in the hippocampus. However,
it is still not clear whether reduction of BDNF levels
in a specific brain region actually causes depressive behavior
or whether BDNF reduction in depressed subjects is just
a side effect. In order to test this, localized RNA interference
(RNAi), was utilized to induce reduction of BDNF expression
in hippocampal subregions by localized injections of doublestrand
RNA (dsRNA) that contains a homologous sequence
to the selected gene. For that purpose, a number of dsRNAs
specific to rat's BDNF mRNA (dsBDNF) were cloned into
lentiviral (LV) vectors to allow long-term interference. Vectors
containing dsBDNF or mock controls were injected bilaterally
via implanted cannulea into the CA3, dentate gyrus
(DG), and subiculum (Sub) of the hippocampus in rats. A
battery of behavioral tests was used to assess aspects of depressive
behavior including anhedonia, motivation, exploration,
and fatigue in the different experimental groups. In

vivo, injections of vectors containing the dsBDNF into both
the CA3 and the subinduced reductions in sucrose preference,
mobility in the forced swim test and home cage locomotion
as compared to the controls. However, exploration of
a novel environment test was not affected. Injection of vectors
containing dsBDNF into the CA3 alone did not affect
any of these behavioral tests. Injection of the vectors into the
DG tended to induce depressive symptom as observed in the

from theoretical and experimental studies has questioned
the direct applicability of the reigning theory of cellular
electrogenesis&#x02014;the Hodgkin-Huxley theory&#x02014;to the AP initiation
in central mammalian neurons. We have shown the
two salient features of AP initiation in neocortical neurons in
vivo: their sharp, step-like initiation dynamics and large variability
of the onset potentials are virtually impossible to capture
by Hodgkin-Huxley type model with realistic parameter
settings. Our quantitative analysis of AP waveforms and initiation
dynamics in a large population of mammalian neocortical
neurons and invertebrate (snail) neurons showed that
the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism could explain AP initiation
in most of snail neurons, but not in vertebrate neocortical
neurons. To describe the AP initiation dynamics, we used
the ratio of errors of exponential over the piecewise linear
fits of the initial portion of AP in the phase plot representation.
This quantitative measure segregates the AP initiation
dynamics in two fundamentally different classes: a gradual
Hodgkin-Huxley-type AP initiation usual in the snail neurons,
and the fast AP initiation typical for the neocortical
neurons. Segregation of neurons by the ratio of fit errors corresponded
well to the segregation by other AP parameters.
Under the conditions which diminish functioning of voltagegated
sodium channels (TTX or reduced extracellular Na+),
not only the amplitude of APs in neocortical neurons was
decreased, as the canonical Hodgkin-Huxley theory predicts,
but also their initiation dynamics was altered, becoming slow
and gradual. These results support our hypothesis that sharp,
step-like onset dynamics of neocortical APs is due to cooperative
activation of voltage-gated sodium channels.</p><p>

dentate gyrus (DG) and CA1, and mimicked acute
stress effects on plasticity in these two subregions. In the
present study, we investigated the mechanisms that mobilize
the BLA to differentially alter plasticity in DG and

antagonist propranolol were micro-infused in
the BLA, 10 minutes prior to BLA activation-induced modulation

for LTP induction and for the impairing effect of amygdala
activation on CA1 LTP. These findings provide further

the accessory olfactory system(AOS, also called vomeronasal

slices, we now show that these two systems differ also in their
physiological properties. Mitral cells in the main olfactory
bulb (MOB) react with a strong bursting response to a brief
electrical shock given to the sensory fibers. In contrast, mitral
cells of the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB) respond to
the same stimulus with only weak graded responses. Given
a strong enough stimulus, however, AOB mitral cells maintained
an elevated firing rate for 10&#x02013;30 seconds, a reaction
which was never observed in the MOB. We further show that
distinct intrinsic properties of these cells underlie the difference
in their responses. We propose that the MOS serves as an analytic tool to dissect the blend of pheromones into
its individual components. In contrast, the AOS process the
mixture of cues as a whole. Hence, both sensory systems may
cooperatively analyze pheromonal cues, each extracting a different
aspect of the sensory information.</p><p>

receptors are expressed in neonatal hippocampal neurons.
Furthermore, it has been shown that central CRH application
results in endocrine, autonomical, and behavioral reactions
comparable to the effects of stress, for example,
in an activation of HPA axis and sympathic nervous system.
Stress produces structural alterations of neuronal morphology,
including dendritic atrophy and loss of excitatory
synapses in the hippocampal formation in the intact animal.
Here we tested the effects of elevated CRH-mediated
neurotransmission on the morphology of dendritic spines
and the density of their associated presynaptic terminals.
Cultured eGFP transfected primary hippocampal neurons
(DIV 7) were incubated with (1) 500 nM synthetic CRH,
(2) 560 nM astressin (CRH1,2-antagonist), (3) CRH + astressin
for 24 hours. Subsequently, pharmacologically stimulated
and control cultures were fixed and dendritic segments
of spine bearing neurons were visualized in optical
stacks using laser scanning confocal microscopy (LSM 510
Meta, Zeiss). Distinct shape parameters of presumed excitatory
spine synapses and spine density were analyzed using
a newly developed image analysis software, which allows
3D-measurements of dendritic spines (length, size of
spine heads and necks, volume, diameter, shape factors). We
found that elevation of CRH neurotransmission does not affect
spine density, but induces a shift of certain morphologically
defined spine classes. The density and the length of
thin spines decreased after CRH treatment, whereas the density
of stubby spines increased. These morphological changes
might indicate a CRH-mediated transition from immature
spines (thin) towards more mature spines (stubby), which most likely changes the functional properties of this in vitro
synaptic network.</p><p>

pain sensitivity, termed &#x0201c;stress-induced analgesia&#x0201d;
(SIA). In the present study, the hypothesis that interleukin-
1 (IL-1) may play a modulatory role in SIA was examined.
Two genetic mouse models impaired in IL-1-signaling and
their wild type (WT) controls were employed: targeted deletion
of the IL-1 receptor type I (IL-1rKO) or transgenic overexpression
of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1raTG). Another
group of C57 mice was acutely administered with IL-1
receptor antagonist (IL-1ra). Mice were exposed to 2 minutes
swim stress at one of three water temperatures: 32&#x000b0;C
(mild stress), 20&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C (moderate stress), or 15&#x000b0;C (severe
stress); and then tested for pain sensitivity using the hot-plate
test. Corticosterone levels were assessed in separate groups
of WT and IL-1rKO mice following exposure to the three
types of stress. Mild stress induced significant analgesia in
the two WT strains and saline-treated mice, but not in the
mutant strains or the IL-1ra-treated mice. Similarly mild
stress induced significantly elevated corticosterone levels in
WT mice, and blunted corticosterone response in IL-1Rko
mice. In contrast, bothWT and mutant strains, as well as IL-
1ra-treated mice, displayed analgesic and corticosterone responses
following moderate and severe stress. Interestingly,
the analgesic response to moderate stress was markedly potentiated
in the IL-1rKO and IL-1raTG mice as well as in
IL-1ra treated mice, compared with their WT controls and
saline-treated mice. The present results support our previous
findings that in the absence of IL-1, stress response
to mild stress is noticeably diminished. However, the analgesic
response to moderate stress is markedly potentiated in
mice with impaired IL-1 signaling, corroborating the antianalgesic
role of IL-1 in several pain modulatory conditions,
including SIA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16695" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SEEING THE IMPOSSIBLE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wolf</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="a496">

The brain does not fuse different images seen by the
two eyes, instead, perception alternates between two views.
Sometimes one eye's view is dominant for longer periods
than that of the other eye, and sometimes perception mixes
the two. High-contrast figures win more often than lowcontrast
figures, brighter than dimmer, moving than stationary,
and high spatial frequency than low (Levelt 1965).
Both high-level and low-level mechanisms may be responsible
for the rivalry pattern, but it is assumed that complex
images, scenes, or other pictures are represented at
higher cortical levels, and therefore affected more by highlevel
mechanisms. We found (ISfN, 2005) that when competing
words versus nonwords, subjects spent a longer time
perceiving nonwords. We explained this advantage of nonwords
over words as saliency of interesting harder stimuli
over familiar easier ones. We have now extended our study to
the relative dominance of possible versus impossible figures
in binocular rivalry. Two red/green pictures were superimposed,
an impossible one and a quite similar possible one.
Participants viewed the pictures through red/green glasses
and tracked the changes in perception by pressing one of
two keys corresponding to the two pictures. We found that
with simple pictures (as with words) impossible figures were
generally dominant for longer periods. On the other hand,
with complex pictures, possible figures had longer dominance
periods. This result is consistent with our hypothesis
that for higher cortical level mechanisms, more interesting
stimuli are more salient and more dominant in binocular
rivalry.</p><p>

(GF) and insecticides such as paraoxon exert their toxicity
by irreversible inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in
the cholinergic nervous system. OP hydrolases (OPH) may
serve as catalytic scavengers and noncorrosive decontamination
of toxic OP's on sensitive surfaces including skin. We
have developed novel asymmetric fluorogenic organophosphates
(Flu-OP) as new molecular probes for screening and
selection of new variants of bacterial OPH or mammalian
paraoxonase (PON1) by directed evolution. It was previously
demonstrated that these OPHs degrade the less toxic P(+)
stereoisomer more rapidly than the toxic P(&#x02212;) isomer. Our
major goal is to use this stereoselective degradation in order
to separate the more toxic stereoisomer out of its racemic
mixture. Subsequently, this isomer will be used for the selection
of new PON1 variants with reversed stereoselectivity.
Eight nerve agents analogous Flu-OPs were synthesized
containing ethyl (E), cyclohexyl (C), pinacolyl (P), and isopropyl
(I) groups attached to methyl phosphonyl (MP) moiety.
The fluorescent leaving groups are OH-MeCyC or OHDDAO.
The inhibition kinetics of human AChE (HuAChE)
and horse serum BChE (Hs-BChE) by Flu-OPs and the time
course of hydrolysis by nine PON1 variants were determined.
Degradation kinetics of Flu-OPs was found to be biphasic
indicating faster hydrolysis of the less toxic P(+) optical isomer.
Interestingly, wt PON1 caused only 50% degradation
of racemic EMP-MeCyC and CMP-MeCyC. We used this
phenomenon for the enzymatic separation of the P(&#x02212;) isomer
of CMP-MeCyC. The bimolecular rate constant (ki) for
HuAChE inhibition by the isolated P(&#x02212;) isomer of CMPMeCyC
is 5 fold greater than that of the P(+) isomer. The
separated P(&#x02212;) isomer of CMP-MeCyC will be used for the
selection of new PON1 variants with reversed stereoselectivity
by directed evolution employing fluorescence activated
cell sorting (FACS) in emulsion compartments.</p><p>

macaques, comparing abilities for recognizing stimulus repetition
when using well-trained sets of images versus novel
images that the monkey had never seen before. The task was
to differentiate between stimuli that had not been previously
presented in the trial, and a repeated stimulus. Since it is assumed
that working-memory delay-activity is required for
recognizing a repetition, and that it takes many presentations
to establish delay activity, it should be difficult for monkeys
to detect repetition of a one-shot learned stimulus. In fact,
the opposite was the case. In each trial the monkeys were
shown a sequence of 2&#x02013;7 stimuli, with the last always being
a repetition of a previous image. This paradigm tested
simultaneous working memory for all trial stimuli. In Experiment
1, we used a fixed set of 16 images, presenting a
random selection from among them in each trial. Each stimulus
was shown hundreds of times during the experiment,
so these stimuli were very familiar to the monkeys. Performance
was very good, with 82% hits and only 4% false positives
(FP). In Experiment 2 we challenged working memory
by introducing a set of 12 000 novel images of different
objects, scenes, and symbols, neither of which the monkey
had seen before. Surprisingly, the monkeys demonstrated
even better performance, 92% hits and 2% FPs. We introduced
&#x0201c;catch&#x0201d; trials, where an image from a preceding trial
was presented as a sample on a subsequent trial. Here, too,
FPs were only 15%. The fact that not all catch trials led to
FPs suggests that monkeys activate a &#x0201c;reset&#x0201d; mechanism between
trials. We conclude that monkeys use a different strategy
for novel stimuli, not based on delay activity but on
the dynamics of the visual response when a stimulus is repeated
versus when it has never been seen before. Both single
cell recording in the inter-trial interval and model simulations
support this presumed mechanism (Romani et al ISfN
2006).</p><p>

pathological conditions it forms insoluble aggregates that are deposited in Lewy bodies, which are the pathological hallmark
of PD. Previously we found that certain PUFA levels

patients' post-mortem brains. Interestingly, we identified
polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) as a factor that induces
aS oligomerization and aggregation in mesencephalic

induce aS oligomerization and aggregation in vivo. For this
aim, we used mouse models of Zellweger syndrome. A major
metabolic consequence of this peroxisomal biogenesis disorder
is accumulation of very long-chain fatty acids and specifically
PUFAs. Indeed we found enhanced levels of soluble
oligomers in Pex13-/- and Pex5-/- mice compared with normal

PUFAs induce aS oligomerization and aggregation in vivo

depending on its timing relative to an odour (Tanimoto
et al 2004Nature): after odour-shock training, the odour predicts
&#x0201c;danger&#x0201d; and therefore flies avoid the odour; in contrast,
after shock-odour training, the odour may predict &#x0201c;relief

a parametric analysis of relief-learning focussing on effects
of gender, training amount, shock intensity, odour identity,

we asked whether conditioned approach after relief&#x02014;
learning shares neuronal requirements with sugar reward
learning. In flies, octopamine is required for sugar reward
learning, whereas it is dispensible for punishment learning
(Schwaerzel et al, 2003 J Neurosci). We therefore tested for
the role of octopamine in relief: learning, using the T&#x000df;HM18
mutant that is impaired in octopamine biosynthesis. Relief:
learning does not seem to require octopamine, whereas sugar
reward learning does. This suggests distinct processing for
the establishment relief versus reward memories. Current
work now focuses on a possible role of dopamine and serotonine
for relief learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16997" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>BISTABILITY IN RELATION TO BEHAVIOR IN CAT

neurons of the cerebellum have led to reevaluation of basic
ideas regarding cerebellar function. Specifically, these neurons
have been demonstrated to transit between two possible
stable membrane potentials, which was also reflected
in their bimodal firing pattern. However, these reports have
been challenged by recent findings claiming that bistability
does not exist in behaving animals, and that it is merely an
artifact of the anesthetics, thus there is as yet no evidence
of a functional relationship between bistability and behavior.
By recording the extracellular activity of identified Purkinje
cells we sought to examine this discrepancy and test
whether bistability was increased, decreased, or unchanged
during behavior that activated the region of the cerebellum
from which we recorded. Specifically, we tested for changes
during feeding in vermal lobule VI, a region of the cerebellum
known for orofacial responses and increased activity
during feeding. Indeed, in our neurons we found increased
activity when the cat was actively feeding. In addition,
we confirmed results in vitro and in anaesthetized animals
that showed long pauses in the activity of Purkinje cells
probably reflecting bistability in their membrane potential.
We find this bistable activity in a substantial fraction of our
cells, but many cells did not exhibit bistable behavior. Preliminary
analysis of the relationship between behavior and
bistability indicates that a fraction of the bistable cells modulate
bistability in relation to behavior. We will present quantitative
analysis of the fraction of the cells so modulated,
and discuss the possible functional implications of these
findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17032" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TOMOSYN INHIBITS EXOCYTOSIS

and SNAP-25 through an R-SNARE domain, forming a complex
that is almost identical in structure to the neuronal
SNARE complex. However, since tomosyn does not contain
a vesicle-attachment transmembrane domain, this complex
cannot support membrane fusion. Tomosyn was shown to
inhibit exocytosis in a variety of cell types and these effects
were attributed to direct competition between tomosyn's
SNARE domain and the R-SNARE Synaptobrevin/VAMP. To characterize the effect of tomosyn overexpression on the attachment
of vesicles to the plasma membrane, we used TIRF
microscopy and examined the mobility of prefusion vesicles
in the region directly adjacent to the membrane. Tomosyn
caused a reduction in the pool of immobile vesicles, the same
pool from which exocytosis preferencially takes place. To understand
the contribution of the different domains of tomosyn
to its inhibitory function, we used a tomosyn mutant
that lacks the entire SNARE domain and does not bind
Syntaxin. Using capacitance measurements we show that this
mutant is a potent inhibitor of exocytosis, similar to the fulllength
tomosyn. Overexpression of the SNARE domain of tomosyn
by itself failed to inhibit exocytosis, indicating that
this domain is not sufficient to perform the regulatory roles
of tomosyn. However, overexpression of a mutant lacking 5
of the 9 WD40 repeats did not lead to inhibition of exocytosis
although this mutant is still bound to Syntaxin. Our
results indicate that tomosyn inhibits exocytosis by interfering
with the immobilization of vesicles at the membrane.
This effect is independent of Syntaxin and the integrity
of the WD40 domain is crucial for tomosyn's inhibitory
function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17145" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEUROPROTECTIVE ACTIVITY OF THE

are designed to possess diverse pharmacological properties
acting on multiple targets has stimulated the development
of the bifunctional drug, Ladostigil, that combines the neuroprotective
effects of the anti-Parkinson's drug, rasagiline,
a selective monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitor, with the
cholinesterase inhibitory activity of rivastigmine in a single
molecule, as a potential treatment for Alzheimer and Lewy
body diseases. Here, we assessed the dual effects of Ladostigil
in terms of molecular mechanism of neuroprotection and
amyloid precursor protein (APP) regulation/processing, using
an apoptotic model of neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells.
Ladostigil dose-dependently decreased cell death via inhibition
of the cleavage and activation of caspase-3 through
a mechanism related to regulation of the Bcl-2 family proteins,
resulting in reduced levels of Bad and Bax and induced
levels of Bcl-2 gene and protein expression. Additionally,
Ladostigil elevated brain-derived neurotrophic factor
and the glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor gene expressions.
We have also followed APP regulation/processing
and found that Ladostigil markedly decreased apoptoticinduced
levels of holo-APP protein without altering APP
mRNA levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism.
In addition, this drug elevated phosphorylated protein kinase
C levels and stimulated the release of the nonamyloidogenic
alpha-secretase proteolytic pathway. Similar to
Ladostigil, its S-isomer, TV3279, is a cholinesterase inhibitor
but lacks MAO inhibitory activity, exerts neuroprotective
properties, indicated that these effects are reside
in the propargyl moiety rather than in the MAO inhibition
moiety of the drugs. These findings indicate that the
antiapoptotic-neuroprotective activity, accompanied by the
ability to modulate APP processing, could make Ladostigil
a potentially valuable drug for the treatment of Alzheimer's
disease.</p><p>

that restrict our ability to segment and define certain tissues.
While typical brain image resolution lies in the order of 1-2
mm, some CNS structures are smaller than that. In this work
we devised an algorithm that detects and defines small subcortical
regions based on contrast enhancement and cluster
analysis. In order to test the algorithm we applied it on the
thalamus. Histologically, the thalamus is composed of at least
9 different nuclei. These nuclei have different cytoarchitectonics
and different functions. It is expected that the different
cyto-architecture will be differentially weighted in a multicontrast
MRI protocol. These contrast differences combined
with clustering algorithm might allow us to define the subnuclei.
9 healthy male subjects aged 25&#x02013;30 underwent MRI
in a 3T scanner. Each volunteer was subject to 10 different
image contrasts with resolution of 1.5mm3. The algorithm
included the following steps: (1) selection of region of interest
(ROI), (2) stretching of the contrast dynamic range,
(3) transformation of the data into its principal component
(PC) space, and (4) clustering. The clustering algorithm detected
as many as 7 significantly different clusters in the thalamus.
In addition, high symmetry between the two thalami of
the same subject was observed. These clusters were assigned
to the different thalamus nuclei-based histologic atlases that
were digitized and coregistered to our template. The position
of the clusters found by our algorithm and the nuclei positions
according to the atlas were very similar in all subjects.
We found that using advanced image processing routines one
can extend the use of MRI to study and define sub-structures
for individual subjects. The use of the virtual-dot-com imaging
algorithm enables not only to detect the subthalamic nuclei
but also to characterize them in terms of contrast fingerprint.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17214" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECT OF GLOBAL VERSUS LOCAL ATTENTION ON

shown to correlate with application of Gestalt laws and object
perception. A few of these studies focused on the perception
of illusory contours as a marker for binding object
parts. In such studies (eg, Tallon-Baudry et al, 1996) gammaband
response was found to be larger in response to coherent
Kanizsa objects (composed of &#x0201c;pacman&#x0201d; figures facing the
center to create an illusory shape) than in response to incoherent
Kanizsa objects (when the &#x0201c;pacmans&#x0201d; are facing outwards
and thus not creating a shape). Since this type of binding
is thought to be an early automatic process, task-related
effects would challenge the hypothesis relating GBR to the
binding mechanism. However, all previous studies have investigated
the binding process in tasks explicitly requiring
subjects to recognize illusory contours, that is, to bind object
parts. The present experiment was designed to explore the
effect of the task on the gamma effect. Two tasks were used
with the same Kanizsa objects: a global task (requiring the
recognition of illusory contours) and a local task (responding
to the appearance of a dark gray pacman). Analysis compared
the GBR to nontarget coherent Kanizsa objects with
the GBR to incoherent Kanizsa objects. In the global task,
coherent objects evoked larger GBR than incoherent objects
at central and posterior sites around 100 ms post stimulus.
However, the local task eliminated this effect and there was
no difference in the GBR of coherent and incoherent objects.
Since binding is thought to be an early automatic process,
this finding suggests that GBR does not reflect binding per se
but rather as a higher mechanism such as memory matching
or the creation of semantic object representations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17269" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>WHAT YOU SEE IS NOT (ALWAYS) WHAT YOU HEAR:

synchrony in the gamma range is also related to the activation
of multisensory object processing. We investigated the effect
of semantic congruity between auditory and visual information
on the GBR. The paradigm consisted of a simultaneous
presentation of pictures and vocalizations of animals, which
were either congruent or incongruent. EEG was measured
in seventeen students while they attended either the auditory
or the visual stimulus and performed a recognition task.
Behavioral results showed a congruity effect, indicating information
from the unattended modality affected behavior.
Visual information affected auditory recognition more than
auditory information affected visual recognition, suggesting
a bias towards reliance on visual information in object recognition.
While the evoked (phase-locked) GBR was unaffected
by congruity, the induced (non-phase-locked) GBR was increased
for congruent compared to incongruent stimuli. This
effect was independent of the attended modality. The results
show that integration of information across modalities,

their capacity for multiple representations for several tasks.

(rotational transformation) involved angular deviation between
cursor movement and hand movement and induced a
specific enhancement in representation of the relevant direction.
The second task (arbitrary association) involved learning

organs of more than one modality. However, our perception of the external world is unitary and coherent. A challenging
question is how these physically distributed feature representations
are combined in the brain to form one homogeneous
percept. We investigated the role of temporal cues
in the binding of visual and auditory features, using the
barn owl's brain as a model system. We explored the ability
of neurons in the optic tectum (OT), a midbrain structure
concerned with orientation and attentive behaviors, to
code the temporal features of the stimulus. Multiunit recordings
were taken from neurons being exposed to 8 seconds of
amplitude-modulated unimodal stimuli (auditory or visual),
and bimodal stimuli consisting of auditory and visual stimuli
presented together congruently or with unmatched fundamental
frequencies. We used vector strength analysis (VS)
to quantify the neurons ability to phase lock to the fundamental
frequency of the stimulus. Our results demonstrate
that, at the low fundamental frequency range, in many neurons,
the VS of the spike train at the stimulus fundamental
frequency was larger for congruent bimodal stimuli than for
unimodal or unmatched bimodal stimuli. Interestingly, bimodal
stimulation resulted with an increase in the response
(number of spikes) above the unimodal response at the onset
of the stimulus, but not at subsequent periods (probably due
to adaptation). Thus, visual-auditory integration was manifested
in better phase locking to the stimulus and not in a
change in the overall spike count. The observation that VS
enhancement was significantly larger at congruent bimodal
stimuli demonstrates that this multimodal enhancement is
based on temporal cues. Our findings provide a better understanding
of the way in which multisensory neurons synthesize
cross-modal information, transforming it into an integrated
product, which no longer resembles the individual
unimodal inputs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17396" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS OF NEUROTRANSMITTERS

in most DNA transactions by controlling the topological
state of the DNA. We showed that the various mouse
brain regions, although exhibited a relatively high topo I activity,
differed in the level of the enzyme activity and protein.
This topo I activity was age and sex dependent and a specific
distribution pattern of this enzyme was observed. Inhibitory
neurons contained the highest topo I activity and
protein level not only in the nucleus but also in the cytoplasm.
These results suggest that topo I might possess a
specific, yet unknown, role in the brain. To further investigate
this possibility we examined the effect of neurotransmitters
on the activity of topo I in mouse cerebellar sections.
Coronary cerebellar sections of 400 &#x003bc;m were prepared
from 3 months old male mice. Following a 1 hour recovery
period, the slices were treated with various concentrations
of neurotransmitters for different intervals. Topo I activity,
protein level, and posttranslational modifications of
the enzyme protein were examined. Exposure of the cerebellar
slices to glutamate for 1 or 5 minutes revealed an increased
inhibition of the enzyme activity with time, while
GABA treatment revealed an immediate inhibition of topo
I which was diminished with time. No changes in the level of
topo I protein were observed, suggesting post-translational
modifications of these enzymes that occur following the
neurotransmitters treatments. Pretreatment of the cerebellar
slices with 3AB, a poly-ADP ribose polymerase inhibitor,
prevented the glutamate but not the GABA induced inhibition
of topo I. The present results together with our previous
published data suggest that the brain topo I activity
is modified by neurotransmitters probably due to activation
of PARP. All together, these data suggest that topo I possesses
a specific role in the brain which differs fromits known
function.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17461" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TWO FUNCTIONALLY OPPOSING FRAGMENTS

In contrast, mice in which the majority of T cells specifically

(SCI) we tested whether CNS-specific T cells can facilitate
neurogenesis in nonneurogenic brain areas. We demonstrated
that T-cell-based immune activation following stroke
induces a robust elevation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus
as well as in the cerebral cortex. Following SCI, a two-fold
increase in neurogenesis from endogenous progenitor cells
was observed in mice that received a dual treatment of immunization
with a weak agonist of myelin-derived peptide

These neurogenesis-promoting effects were correlated with
microglial production of BDNF and noggin. Our results suggest

the subjective experience of pain. Using fMRI we investigated
the neural mechanism that underlies such possible
association. Twelve subjects were scanned while receiving
a sequence of twelve subjectively defined painful warm

warm stimuli. Six of the painful stimuli were preceded by
