hippocampus-dependent memory in rodents. Our primary approach is to generate cell type and adult-restricted knockout
mice and characterize them using multifaceted methods including molecular and cellular biology, in vitro and in
vivo electrophysiology, confocal and two photon microscopy and behavioral tasks. The data obtained to date indicate that
NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in area CA1 plays a pivotal role in special and other hippocampus dependent
learning and memory. The same receptors and synaptic plasticity in area CA3 are dispensable for the acquisition
of reference memory, but play an important role in &#x0201c;pattern completion&#x0201d;&#x02014;the ability to recall an entire experience with limited recall cues, as well as in one trial-based rapid learning. NMDA receptor function in dentate gyrus (DG) is
also dispensable for reference memory, but is important in &#x0201c;pattern separation&#x0201d;, the ability to form distinct memories of similar events. These studies attest the power of this multifaceted&#x02014;genetic, physiological and behavioral&#x02014;approach in understanding mechanisms underlying cognition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e158" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SPACE AND TIME OF CORTICAL ACTIVITY</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Abeles</surname><given-names>Moshe</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar Ilan University, Ramat Gan, Israel</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>To understand how the cortex works, we need to define accurate scales in space and time.

studies have parceled the cortex into different scales such as cytoarchitectonic areas, hyper-columns, mini-columns, single

individual neurons appear to be the largest unit that can be used to understand cortical information processing mechanisms.</p><p>Activity can be measured by fMRI (or PET) on a time scale of seconds, by EEG (or MEG) on a time scale of a small
fraction of a second, and by microelectrodes on a time scale of milliseconds or less. A single neuron can be part of different
processes at different times. It remains unclear how fast a neuron can switch its functional properties. If such switching
can be made on a ms time scale, fast and efficient computations can be made. We show that the temporal precision of
cortical neurons can be better than 1 ms.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e177" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE NEURAL BASIS OF LEARNING AND MEMORY MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DRUG ADDICTION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Everitt</surname><given-names>Barry J.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, UK</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Drug addiction is increasingly viewed as the endpoint of a series of transitions frominitial drug use, when a drug is voluntarily taken because it has reinforcing, often hedonic, effects through loss of control over this behaviour such that it becomes

upon interactions between pavlovian and instrumental learning processes and further, that the transition from an
initial stage when drug seeking and taking represents a voluntary, goal-directed action, to a more habitual and compulsive
mode represents a transition at the neural level from prefrontal cortical to striatal control over such behaviour. Experiments
will be discussed that demonstrate the involvement of limbic corticostriatal systems in drug-seeking behaviour,
emphasizing the importance of drug-associated stimuli acting as conditioned reinforcers. In addition, I will consider
the possibility of reducing the motivational impact of drugassociated stimuli by disrupting the process of memory reconsolidation

an underlying impairment in the rapid selection and accurate sequencing of orofacial movements most evident in
speech. Structural neuroimaging in the affected members revealed bilateral abnormalities in a number of motor, and
speech and language-related brain regions. Functional neuroimaging during verb generation and repetition tasks disclosed
a distinctly atypical pattern of activation (i.e., diffuse, bilateral, and located predominantly in posterior cortical
regions). Comparison between affected and unaffected family members indicated that the FOXP2 mutation is associated
with significant underactivation in several regions that had been found to be morphologically abnormal, including
the inferior frontal gyrus. Together, these structural and functional MR results provide a coherent explanation
for the affected members' striking and persistent disorder.</p><p>The neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings will be related to the genetic basis of the disorder in the KE family
and to that of other cases with mutations and/or deletions of the FOXP2 gene, and to the pattern of gene expression
during embryological development in humans, mice and songbirds. The convergence of data from the behavioural,
neuroimaging, and gene expression studies lead to a tentative model of the neuroanatomy of the speech and language

<bold>Background</bold>: An increasing number of studies using a variety of experimental procedures in both animals and humans have demonstrated the significant contribution made by the orbital frontal cortex to the flexible monitoring of actions based on rewards processing. Yet, much remains to be discovered about the role played by this structure in the development of emotional responses and goal-directed behaviors, which are the prerequisites for the development of complex
social behavior.</p><p>
<bold>Methods and Results</bold>: Three studies will be presented investigating behavioral and cognitive changes following neonatal damage of the orbital frontal cortex in infant rhesus monkeys. The first study demonstrates that neonatal orbital
frontal lesions alter the modulation of fear and defensive responses towards threatening social stimuli, indicating poor
modulation of social stimuli. These findings were confirmed by a second study showing that these same neonatal lesions
disrupted choice selection predicted by affective signals but not by visual signals conveying reward contingency. The last
study investigated how the deficits in flexible monitoring of social cues will affect dyadic social interactions. The data indicated
a lack of interests in initiating and maintaining social contacts with operated-controls in animals with neonatal orbital
frontal lesions.</p><p>
<bold>Discussion</bold>: These results are consistent with orbital frontal damage altering the complex and flexible monitoring of the reward values of emotional and social cues to select appropriate actions, even when the damage occurs in infancy. These functional alterations may in turn reduce general motivation to engage in social interactions. These experimental data shed some lights into the crucial role of this cortical area in developmental psychopathology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e243" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>OFF-LINE MEMORY PROCESSING, AS ASSESSED BY FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maquet</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Cyclotron Research Centre, University of Li&#x000e9;ge, Belgium</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Memory consolidation is the process by which fresh, initially labile, memories are reorganized into enduring stable memories.
At the systems level, memory consolidation results in a progressive rearrangement of memories which can eventually
be stored in circuits different from those in which they were initially encoded. For instance, declarative memories,
originally heavily dependent on mesio-temporal structures, are thought to be gradually restructured in mature memories
stored in more distributed cortical networks.</p><p>A growing body of data suggests that sleep is involved in the consolidation of declarative memories. We will provide
evidence from fMRI studies that sleep deprivation hinders the plastic changes that normally occur during sleep and
alters the brain responses subsequently recorded at retest. The basic mechanism underpinning memory consolidation
seems to consist in the replay of firing sequences in neuronal populations involved in learning. The replay of firing
sequences in neuronal populations involved in learning seems to underpin systems-level memory consolidation during
sleep. Evidence for a replay of neuronal firing sequences has been collected in rodents during both NREM and REM
sleep within the hippocampus, as well as in the neocortex. Consistent with data collected in rodents, we reported taskrelated
experience-dependent increases in the hippocampal and neocortical activity in humans during NREM sleep following
spatial learning.</p><p>An &#x0201c;offline&#x0201d; coordinated reactivation of distributed components of memory traces has also been observed during immediate post-training wakefulness in non human Primates and rodents. Likewise, using fMRI in humans, we were recently
able to indirectly identify learning-related changes in spontaneous brain activity during wakefulness, by characterizing
the modulation they impose on responses to an unrelated cognitive challenge.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e264" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SATELLITE MEETING TO THE EBBS 2007 CONFERENCE 15 SEPTEMBER 2007</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>and Behaviour</surname><given-names>Stress, Brain</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Recent Developments on Pharmacology, Modelling and Translational Issues</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The goal of this meeting is to shed new light on the mechanisms underlying the effects of stress on brain and behaviour

Subsequent research, however, demonstrated that psychological stimuli are also strong activators of the endocrine system and there was
increasing evidence that &#x02018;stress hormones&#x02019; such as adrenocortical steroids profoundly influence brain excitability. Today the stress response is regarded as an alarm system which is initiated whenever there is a discrepancy between what an organism is expecting and what really exists. Uncertainty, lack of information or loss of control induce alarm reactions whereas the presence of social support, information and control reduce the alarm reactions. Therefore, the stress
response per se is not harmful or pathological in itself. Only when demanding, prolonged and sustained, body and brain
homeostasis can be threatened, and health may be endangered. Since this is a consistent finding across species including
man, it is important to understand the relationship between stressors and diseases. To refine our knowledge of
the underlying processes neurobiological theories emerging from preclinical experimentation are tested on human subjects
(bench to bedside) or vice versa where information obtained from investigations in human subjects can be used
to improve our understanding of the biological principles (bedside to bench). Examples of this translational approach
are presented and discussed in the first part of the Satellite Meeting starting with investigations in nonhuman primates
and leading to investigations in human subjects. The intent is not only to summarize facts on the role of the brain in
the stress response but also to promote discussion for future studies that will lead to the better mechanistic understanding
of stress-related disturbances and their treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e300" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL ASSESSMENT IN NON-HUMAN PRIMATES: CONTRIBUTION TO

processes that are enhanced by stress include motivation to avoid punishment, selective attention, and memory consolidation;
and processes that are inhibited by stress include motivation for reward, behavioural inhibition, divided attention,
executive functioning and memory recall. Because of the development of tasks based on non-verbal responses to
visual stimuli, each of these neuropsychological processes can be studied using very similar paradigms in humans and nonhuman
primates. This, combined with the high monkey-human homology in terms of (1) the physiology and neurobiology
of stress, and (2) the neurobiological circuitry underlying behavioural processes, allows for reliable translation of
findings between monkey and human. Examples of the study of effects of stress on neuropsychological functioning will be
presented for the common marmoset, squirrel monkey and rhesus macaque, as will ideas for future research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e317" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>STRESS AND HUMAN EXPLICIT MEMORY: EFFECTS ON ENCODING, CONSOLIDATION AND RETRIEVAL</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nadel</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hoscheidt</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Payne</surname><given-names>J.

to hippocampus minimise the impact of current and past aversive events, by uncoupling acute stress responses and preventing
rumination. We have used pharmacoMRI in volunteers and in antisocial and anxious individuals to test some
of these ideas. Intravenous administration of the 5HT2c agonist mCPP evokes subjective anxiety and MRI responses in
amygdala and caudate that are blocked by oral pre-treatment with mirtazepine, a 5HT2c antagonist. Tryptophan depletion reduces central 5HT neurotransmission and selectively reduced the detection of fear in face emotion processing. Increased
5HT release induced by citalopram has the opposite effect. These findings are predicted by the DRN-5HT2c
fear hypothesis. However, amygdala fMRI responses evoked by fearful faces were attenuated rather than enhanced by iv
citalopram pre-treatment. 5HT modulation of MRI activations evoked by go/no-go, reward, worry and social tasks and
experiments in the clinical groups will be presented.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deakin</surname><given-names>JFW</given-names></name><name><surname>Graeff</surname><given-names>FG</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodgers</surname><given-names>RJ</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Critique: 5-HT and mechanisms of defence</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Psychopharmacology</italic></source><year>1991</year><volume>5</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>305</fpage><lpage>341</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22282829</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Deakin</surname><given-names>JFW</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>5-HT, antidepressant drugs and the psychosocial origins of depression</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Psychopharmacology</italic></source><year>1996</year><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>31</fpage><lpage>38</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">22302725</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lowry</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>PL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hay-Schmidt</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Mikkelsen</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Shekhar</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Modulation of anxiety circuits by serotonergic systems</article-title><source><italic>Stress</italic></source><year>2005</year><volume>8</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>233</fpage><lpage>246</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16423712</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e502" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>II Behaviour and Modelling <break/> BEHAVIOUR AND MODELING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dolan</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, UCL, London, UK</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A fundamental principle in the organization of complex organisms is that of homeostasis. Perturbation in homeostasis
provides a metric of the degree to which ongoing environmental interactions are stressful. The brains response
to stress involves central cognitive repertoires (including appraisal, arousal, prediction, cognitive control) as well as peripherally
mediated responses mediated via autonomic nervous and hormonal systems (a rapidly acting neural and a
slow acting hormonal mechanism). Ideally both act in concert to integrate short and long term motivational needs in
relation to current and, anticipated, future states of the environment. A maladaptive response to acute stress, or the
emergence of chronic stress, is known to exert a profound negative impact on psychological and physical well-being
leading to disorders such as depression, anxiety and cognitive under-function. Thus, key issues in understanding
the impact of stress include the relationship between stress and aversive processing, the influence of neuro-humoural
responses on neuronal plasticity, neurogenesis, as well as how stress interacts with individual genetic endowment. This
mini-symposium will address each of these themes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e521" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>COMPUTATIONAL MODELS OF AVERSIVE PROCESSING: SEROTONIN, DOPAMINE AND STRESS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dayan</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Gatsby Computational Neuroscience Unit, University College London, UK</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A wealth of evidence supports the notions that (i) the phasic activity of dopamine cells reports a temporally sophisticated prediction error for the delivery of rewards; that (ii) targets of these cells, including the amygdala and ventral and

also the actions that will result in maximizing their delivery; and that (iii) there is a complex interaction between
this scheme for the control of behaviour, which is associated with outcome-insensitive habits, and a model-based scheme,
associated with outcome-sensitive or goal-directed actions, which appears to be realized in prefrontal structures. Despite
an impressively extensive range of experimental findings, our understanding of the nature and realization of aversive processing
appears to be rather less far advanced. One possibility is that serotonin might play a role as the sort of aversive opponent
to dopamine that has been mooted and investigated from a psychological perspective. However, appetitive and
aversive processing are far from being mirror images of each other psychologically, and indeed dopamine and serotonin,
despite evidence for some mutually inhibitory interactions, are far from being mirror images of each other neurally. We
will provide a computational examination of aversive processing in general, and opponency in particular.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e538" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A SYSTEMS-LEVEL MODEL OF STRESS EFFECTS ON COGNITION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>J.

An accumulating body of evidence
from human and animal studies reveals that while the acute response to stress (i.e., heightened cognition) is an adaptive
mechanism, exposures to uncontrollable (unpredictable and inescapable) stress can subsequently produce detrimental
neurocognitive effects, particularly in the hippocampus. Rodent studies further indicate that stress impairs longterm
potentiation (LTP), a leading candidate cellular mechanism of information storage, in the hippocampus. We have
recently discovered that amygdala lesions/inactivation and prefrontal cortex lesions block and exacerbate, respectively,
stress-induced impairments in hippocampal LTP and spatial memory. Moreover, single unit recording data indicate that
stress alters the firing rate of place cells recorded from dorsal hippocampus, providing an empirical bridge between stress
effects on synaptic plasticity and spatial memory. Based on these findings, we will present a conceptual model of the central
stress mechanism (a neural-endocrine network comprising of amygdala, prefrontal cortex and glucocorticoids) regulating
hippocampal functioning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e588" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE INTERACTION BETWEEN AFFECTIVE TRAITS AND STRESS IN LEARNING: EXPERIMENTS AND MODELLING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Luksys</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sandi</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Brain Mind Institute, Swiss Federal Institute of Tchnology (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Acute stress regulates different aspects of behavioural learning through the action of stress hormones and neuromodulators. Stress effects depend on its type, intensity, timing, and the learning paradigm. However, animals with different
affective traits (such as anxiety, impulsivity, and novelty reactivity) can be affected by stressors in different, sometimes
even opposing ways. In the first part of the talk we will give an overview of rat and mouse experiments, showing a variety
of examples, how affective traits may influence stress effects on learning and memory. Our animals, characterized prior
to learning experiments, are tested on different tasks, where stress type, intensity, and timing are manipulated. In addition,
we relate behavioural effects to levels of stress hormones (glucocorticoids), providing evidence that differential stress
reactivity is really responsible for differences in learning. In the second part of the talk, we will describe how mouse behaviour
can be formalized and studied using reinforcement learning (RL) models. In this framework, the effects of stress
and genetic background on learning and memory can be attributed to differential dynamics of model meta-parameters

Corroborating evidence comes fromstudies as discussed by Oitzl et al., linking genetic vulnerability and stress exposure to
the expression of fear-related behaviours in mice. Likewise, chronic stress has been shown to alter serotonergic function
and gene expression related to neuroplasticity (Flugge and Abumaria), thought to play a role in depression and anxiety.
Consequently, compounds targeting stress responsivity and HPA axis abnormalities have been proposed as potential
novel therapeutic approaches with improved efficacy to treat depression and anxiety disorders (Thomson et al.). Fundamental
to this idea is the hypothesis that abnormalities in stress systems represent a final common pathway in these
disorders. Here we will discuss whether indeed this is the case. A full understanding of the relationship between stress
reactivity and anxiety and depression is pertinent as this relationship will determine whether treatment strategies
aimed at stress responsivity will be best positioned as monotherapy to treat the anxiety and depression, or whether
they require co-medication with other drugs, whether their primary use will be during the acute phase, or whether they
may be of prime benefit in preventing relapse. Further, by broadening the concept of altered stress reactivity beyond
anxiety and depression, it can be expected that these types of compounds will also be of benefit in other disorders, including
drug abuse, psychosis and sleep disorders.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e630" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IMPACT OF STRESS ON GENE EXPRESSION RELATED TO SEROTONERGIC NEUROTRANSMISSION:

(TPH) activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). We studied the effects of chronic social stress and a chronic treatment
with the specific serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram on TPH expression in the DRN using a resident-intruder
paradigm. Male Wistar rats were daily confronted with a dominant Lister Hooded rat during five weeks and received
citalopram (via drinking water; 30 mg/kg/day) during four weeks starting on week 2 of the stress period. Citalopram
normalized several stress-induced behavioral parameters, e.g. performance in the sucrose preference test ([<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]).</p><p>Quantitative Real-time PCR and Western blotting confirmed previous data revealing strong TPH2 expression in
the DRN but showed also that TPH1 is weakly expressed in this nucleus. Expression of the two TPH genes was found to
be differentially regulated: TPH1 mRNA was increased more than three-fold by chronic stress and normalized by chronic
citalopram. In contrast, TPH2 mRNA expression was not affected by stress but was downregulated by citalopram (to less
than 50%) in both stressed and control animals. TPH protein was upregulated by stress exposure and the effect was
prevented by citalopram. The SSRI had no effect on serotonin transporter mRNA but reduced 5-HT1A autoreceptor
mRNA in stressed animals. These data shed new light on presumptive mechanisms underlying the beneficial effects of
citalopram, and possibly other SSRIs, in rebalancing the central nervous 5-HT system. Moreover, synaptic vesicle protein
2b mRNA and protein were increased by chronic stress and normalized by the antidepressant indicating that the SSRI
has a balancing effect on the neurotransmitter release machinery. Citalopram prevented the stress-induced upregulation
of mRNA for CREB binding protein, an important factor in CREB-regulated transcription. In conclusion, our data
demonstrate that in the rat DRN, citalopram blocks effects of chronic stress on distinct genes related to neurotransmitter
release and neuroplasticity ([<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]).</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B4"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Rygula</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Abumaria</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name><name><surname>Fl&#x000fc;gge</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Citalopram counteracts depressive-like symptoms evoked by chronic social stress in

Genetic factors are implicated, but individual vulnerabilities depend on gene*life-events interactions. A fundamental question in biomedical research addresses the molecular mechanisms of stress system disorders. Glucocorticoid stress hormones acting via mineralocorticod (MR) and glucocorticoid receptors (GR) in the brain are in the center of interest. They modulate differential aspects of affective expressions
and cognition; facilitating as well as impairing actions on memory have been reported. Based on animal models,
I will discuss the action of corticosteroids and their antagonism. BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice with a distinct profile
of central and peripheral markers of stress system activity will be used to demonstrate, that glucocorticoids and genetic
make-up contribute in a distinct fashion to the expression of different fear behaviours, and the acquisition, consolidation
and extinction of fear memories. The influence of chronic stress on emotional expressions, responses to novelty, learning
and memory in C57BL/6 mice will be demonstrated in relation to the effects of the GR antagonist Mifepristone.

clinical efficacy of antidepressants has not been achieved. This observation is unsurprising, considering that all antidepressant
drugs modulate neurotransmission as a common mechanistic endpoint. It is intriguing to speculate that improvement of drug efficacy may only emerge when pharmacological agents acting at nonmonoamine drug targets are
developed. Further, our lack of understanding of the mechanisms underlying depressive illness is a major hurdle in our
quest towards developing better antidepressants. Chronic exposure to stressful life events in combination with susceptibility
factors is suggested to contribute to an individual developing depression. Exposure to stress results in activation
of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis and hyperactivity of this system is the most consistently described
neuroendocrine abnormality in depression. Irregularities include elevated cortisol concentrations, dysfunctional glucocorticoid
receptor activity, blunted corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) receptor-1 function and increased sensitivity
to arginine vasopressin (AVP). Observations that clinical remission is associated with normalisation of HPA axis
activity suggest that drugs that intervene with this system could have benefit for the treatment of depression. Recently,
selective inhibitors of the vasopressin V1b receptor have emerged which, by counteracting vasopressinergic hyperdrive
of the HPA axis, are proposed to have potential as a novel antidepressant agent. Here I will describe the pharmacology
and preclinical behavioural profile of a novel, high affinity selective V1b receptor antagonist and speculate on
the challenges for successful clinical application of such a drug.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e862" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SYMPOSIA <break/>S1: The retrosplenial cortex: revealing its role in memory and limbic system function</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

interconnected. Furthermore, these brain areas are part of the so-called Papez Circuit, which originally had been envisioned
to play a role in emotions and emotional expression. Whereas components of the limbic system, such as the
amygdala, are involved in emotions, the Papez circuit most likely only plays a minor role in emotions, however, in contrast
it does play a major role in learning and memory, especially, spatial learning and memory. The caudal, midline
limbic cortex, the retrosplenial cortex consists of three areas, retrosplenial granular a and b, and retrosplenial dysgranular
cortex, whereas the anterior thalamus consists of four nuclei, the anterior dorsal, anterior ventral, anteriormedial
nuclei and the laterodorsal nucleus. Each cortical area has its own specific connections with each of the four anterior
thalamic nuclei, and most of these connections are reciprocal. Furthermore, the retrosplenial cortices are themselves
interconnected, they project to the hippocampal formation, and the subicular cortex projects directly and indirectly,
through the mamillary bodies, to the anterior thalamic nuclei, which project to the retrosplenial cortex, i.e., the
Papez circuit. To better understand the functions of this circuit and its components, we and others, have done a series
of learning and memory studies following lesions of components of this circuit. In simple terms, small lesions involving
only one component of the system do not lead to measurable behavioral deficits, only lesions involving several parts lead
to learning and memory deficits, with a direct correlation between lesion size and amount of spatial learning deficit.
Together these data lead to the view that the retrosplenial cortex-anterior thalamus system form a network of parallel
pathways, that can partially compensate for loss of one pathway.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e925" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FUNCTIONAL SUBDIVISIONS WITHIN THE RODENT RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vann</surname><given-names>S.

by sparing the more caudal part of this region. Subsequent research has shown that the size of retrosplenial
cortex lesions result is crucial in determining the extent of impairments on spatial memory tasks, and evidence from
both lesion and immediate-early gene studies have implicated the entire rostral-caudal extent of this structure in spatial
memory. In addition to rostro-caudal divisions within the retrosplenial cortex there are distinct cytoarchitectonic
subregions within this structure with different patterns of connections. The two major subdivisions comprise granular
and dysgranular retrosplenial cortex, with granular being separated further into granular a and b. Selective lesions
of the dysgranular retrosplenial cortex impair allocentric performance of the radial-arm maze, consistent with
the fact that this subregion is the primary recipient of visual inputs within the retrosplenial cortex. Finally, differential
involvement of all the subregions within the retrosplenial cortex (granular cortex a, granular cortex b, dysgranular)
at both rostral and caudal levels has been shown using immediate-early gene activation in normal rats performing a
spatial working memory task. Together, these data highlight the functional heterogeneity of the retrosplenial cortex, consistent

One of its major afferent sources is the anterior thalamic nuclei complex. Previous studies have shown that large rostral thalamic
lesions do not induce cell loss in the retrosplenial cortex, but reduce cytochrome oxidase levels and markers for
acetyl choline. In a series of studies with rats we have found that the expression of the immediate-early genes (IEGs) c-fos
and zif268 show a dramatic, and permanent, fall in retrosplenial cortex following selective, anterior thalamic lesions.
This IEG loss, which was most marked in the superficial layers of the granular retrosplenial cortex (up to 90% loss), is
found irrespective of the lesion method, strain of rat, and time post surgery. Subsequent in situ hybridrisation studies
have confirmed the depletion of c-fos RNA in these superficial levels while microarray studies have provided a fuller picture
of the retrosplenial cortex changes consequent to anterior thalamic damage. Electrophysiological studies of retrosplenial
slices taken from rats with previous anterior thalamic lesions reveal a loss of plasticity (long term depression) in
the local circuits within the superficial layers of granular retrosplenial cortex. These findings of cortical hypoactivity and
a loss of plasticity not only indicate a covert pathology but may also be directly relevant for a number of neurological
conditions (Korsakoffs disease, Mild Cognitive Impairment, Alzheimers disease) that are characterised by both memory
loss and prominent pathology in sites connected with the retrosplenial cortex.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e959" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>WHAT CAN FUNCTIONAL NEUROIMAGING STUDIES IN HUMANS TELL US ABOUT THE FUNCTIONS OF

cannabinoids contribute to depolarization-induced suppression

while higher doses are neuroprotective. At the same
time, low doses have little or no effect on memory formation
although this would be expected given that hippocampal
cells are highly vulnerable to this treatment. By contrast,
high doses of cannabinoids that should protect neurons in
fact lead to memory impairment.</p><p>These two examples highlight the need for a wider and more
detailed analysis into the function of the endocannabinoid
system using systemic approaches. Towards this end, we have
selected four important areas of research from which a major

state of withdrawal drive the user to extremes to obtain the drug. Repeated drug use easily results in addiction where
successful treatment is deterred by high incidence of relapse which remains the primary problem in treating drug dependence.
Vulnerability to relapse after withdrawal is proposed to be the result of neuroadaptive processes within the brain
which lead to impairment in the mechanisms that mediate the perceived value of the drug and the appearing of emotive
changes such as anxiety and dysphoria during withdrawal. Although of some help, medications available to date do not
completely prevent the probability of returning to compulsive drug-seeking, leaving patients vulnerable to drug use relapse.
Thus, the identification of new pharmacological anticraving treatments for use in the maintenance of patients in
a drug-free state is a priority issue. Over the last years, we and others demonstrated that the endocannabinoid system
is crucially involved not only in the modulation of the reinforcing effects of most widely abused drugs but it also plays a
key role in the regulation of relapsing episodes. Indeed, while cannabinoid CB1 receptor stimulation may elicit relapse not
only to cannabinoid seeking but also to cocaine, heroin, alcohol and methamphetamine, this effect is significantly attenuated,
if not fully prevented, by pretreatment with the CB1 receptor antagonist rimonabant. The conspicuous progress
recently made in delineating the role of the endocannabinoid system in relapse to drug seeking has important consequences
for human situations, since the risk of relapse in an abstinent individual may be significantly attenuated by CB1
antagonist preventive treatment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1091" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>[11C]JHU75528, A PET RADIOLIGAND FOR IMAGING OF CEREBRAL CANNABINOID CB1 RECEPTORS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Horti</surname><given-names>A.

ratio (3.4) ever reported for a CB1 radioligand. Pre-administration of SR141716 inhibited 11C-JHU binding
in all regions of the mouse brain examined, except the thalamus, a region with low density of CB1. A robust incorporation
of radioactivity into the baboon brain was seen in a PET study after injection of 11C-JHU. The highest accumulation
of radioactivity occurred in the putamen, frontal cortex and cerebellum and the lowest level of radioactivity was detected
in the thalamus and pons. Injection of SR141716 reduced regional radioactivity concentrations in the regions with high
and intermediate density of CB1 to the level in pons. Essentially a complete blockade in the CB1-rich brain regions after
administration of SR141716 confirmed specific binding of 11C-JHU at CB1 receptors in vivo. The BP value of 11CJHU
in baboon putamen obtained with the simplified tissue reference was 1.5. This value is substantially higher than that
published for [123/124I]AM281 (lentiform nucleus, BP=0.2-0.4), the only available radioligand for CB1 tomographic
imaging in humans. The overall results suggest that 11C-JHU holds promise as a successful CB1 radioligand for PET imaging
in humans.</p></body><floats-group><fig id="fig27-1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Averaged saggital baboon brain PET images of [11C]JHU75528 scans, displayed on aligned MRI images. Lines

Depolarization-induced Suppression of Inhibition (DSI) is an endocannabinoid-
mediated feedback whereby hippocampal pyramidal neurons (as well as principal neurons from other brain areas)
suppress activity of GABA neuron inputs. Likewise, DSE (suppression of excitation) occurs on glutamate neuron inputs
in brain regions other than hippocampus.</p><p>In vivo studies show that exogenously applied cannabinoids do not produce effects predicted by the DSI mechanism.
Instead, exposure to cannabinoids suppresses activity of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and alters (inhibits)
ensemble responses to behavioral events critical to DNMS performance. While some inhibition may be consistent with
DSE, only DSI has been shown to operate in hippocampus. Alteration of neural circuits involving connected brain areas
do not account for the fact that local application of cannabinoids to hippocampus alone produce similar effects to systemic
application. Likewise, exposure to the CB1 receptor antagonist Rimonabant, or endocannabinoid synthesis or reuptake
blockers also fail to produce effects predicted by the in vitro findings. While exposure to cannabinoids suppresses
working memory in behavioral tasks such as DNMS, modulating endocannabinoid actions via antagonists and reuptake
blockers often fail to produce effects on working memory or the neural ensemble activity underlying such memory.</p><p>Therefore, in vivo studies have more to reveal about the role cannabinoids in shaping neural responses to complex
stimuli than can be predicted by in vitro studies alone. While DSI and DSE likely contribute to the effects of cannabinoids
in vivo, there is still a missing link between activation of cannabinoid receptors and cannabinoid effects on memory
and behavior.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1281" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ENDOCANNABINOID FUNCTION IN COGNITION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Riedel</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>School Medical Science, University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, UK</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A large number of previous studies have revealed that cannabinoids and the endocannabinoid system (ECS) are involved in learning and memory processes.

and are often difficult to dissociate from effects of cannabinoids on motor function, appetite, general motility, psychoactive
experiences, reaction times etc. A more uniform and less variable result can be obtained by utilising in vitro
systems to investigate the actions of the cannabinoid system. While many of these investigations produce interesting data,
they contribute little to our global understanding of the function of the ECS.</p><p>Two examples are selected to highlight a) the discordance of in vivo and in vitro results with respect to memory formation,
and b) the difference between global and local in vivo actions of the ECS.</p><p>(a) Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a model of synaptic plasticity which is widely held to reflect the cellular underpinnings
of memory formation. In hippocampal slices, cannabinoids impair LTP. We tested the synthetic cannabinoid
receptor (CR) antagonist WIN 55,212-2 intraperitoneally in doses of 1&#x02013;3 mg/kg and it impaired spatial learning
in the water maze. WIN presumable acted via hippocampal CRs since micro-pump injectedWIN also impaired learning
(8.9 ng/day). The same doses, however, reduced paired-pulse depression (PPD) of CA1 neurons ex vivo and enhanced
long-term potentiation (LTP) in slices excised from treated animals. It would have been predicted based on in vivo results,
that LTP was reduced in WIN-treated animals so that learning was impaired.</p><p>(b) AM281 is a selective antagonist for the neuronally expressed CRs. Hippocampal slices treated with CR antagonists
show normal or reduced LTP. When administered systemically, AM281 impaired spatial learning in the water maze.
At the same time, there was no effect of CR antagonists on paired-pulse depression or LTP when given alone. Local administration
of AM281 into the hippocampus, however, facilitated learning and prolonged/protected spatial memory,
similar to previous work.</p><p>Data presented suggest that extrapolation of in vitro results to predict in vivo effects of cannabinoids and the ECS
is difficult, and that even systemic administration of drugs may provide only limited information as to the specific role
of localised populations of CRs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1306" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S3: Avian brain and cognition</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

the long-term gain rate. The underlying cognitive processes are basically identical to those of the impulsive choice of an
immediate-small food item (the prey item) against a latelarge alternative (the lost opportunity). The foragers should
therefore be able to precisely anticipate the profitability and control the level of impulsiveness accordingly. To address
these issues, we examined weeks-old domestic chicks in operant behaviors, in which each of colored cue beads was associated
with a food reward of certain amount (A), delay (D: either temporal or spatial) and consumption cost (C); both
D and C were given by the period of time required for approaching and consuming the food item, respectively. Concurrent
binary choice tests suggested a currency (V) as given by V = A/(D + C), somehow reminiscent to the Mazur's formulation
of subjective value. Localized lesions of the nucleus accumbens (core) in ventral striatum enhanced the impulsiveness
without impairments in the amount based choices, suggesting a shift toward proximity-dominant choices with a
biased stress on D. Localized lesions of the arcopallium intermedium in the &#x0201c;cortex&#x0201d; analogue (association area with massive descending projections), on the other hand, caused costaversive choices with a biased stress on C.

In rats, exposure to
training-related cues is able to reactivate the associated memory, to reinstate disrupted memories, and to improve retention
performance. Using a brightness avoidance discriminative task, we showed that exposure to training related cues has
both behavioural and neural consequences. At a behavioural level, retrieval cues improve the subsequent retention performance.
While the nature of the most efficient cue to promote retrieval varies according to the age of memory, their facilitative
effects on retention performance have the same time development and can be reproduced in an appetitive version
of the task. At a neural level, we showed that exposure to retrieval cues is accompanied by a release of plasmatic ACTH
and activates brain structures including several amygdala and hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus accumbens and the insular
cortex. In addition, the retrieval cue facilitative effect requires the integrity of the anterior cingulate and the prelimbic part
of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) but not the hippocampus. In addition, the effects of the retrieval cues can be
blocked by various treatments, including injections of a CRF antagonist (CP- 154,526), of the non-selective opiate antagonist
naloxone. Exposure to retrieval cues is accompanied by dopamine release within the prelimbic cortex, and D1 antagonist
infusion in this area abolishes the facilitative effect of retrieval cues. Interestingly, the processes involved are closed
from those mediating cue-induced relapse in drug-seeking and cue-driven PTSD syndrome. It is proposed that exposure
to environmental cues always activates an amygdalo-corticostriatal neural circuitry which is the support of memory reactivation,
whatever the valence and intensity of the memory. The potential function and dysfunction of such emotional
cueinduced memory retrieval will be further discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1472" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EMOTION CAN MODULATE MEMORY RETRIEVAL IN HUMANS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seassau</surname><given-names>Magali</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Levy</surname><given-names>Richard</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gisquet-Verrier</surname><given-names>Pascale</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>We investigated whether emotion may exert a direct influence on the efficacy of memory retrieval. Subjects were submitted to an unexpected recognition test of affective pictures after an encoding phase during which theses pictures were
associated with neutral background pictures. At the recognition phase, the background pictures were used as primes
under implicit condition. The prime were either the background picture initially associated with the affective picture
at the encoding phase or a background picture initially associated with another affective picture of the same valence or of a different valence. Four intervals of retention were used and subjects were randomly assigned to one of four
groups according to the interval of retention. Reaction times were found shorter when the emotional picture was primed
by a background initially associated with a picture sharing the same emotional valence. The above effect was particularly
marked for positive emotional pictures. In addition, this effect varied according to the interval of retention: After
short retention intervals (one hour), background pictures were more effective to facilitate the recognition of the
specific affective pictures to which they were associated to, whereas after long intervals (two weeks), background pictures
facilitated the retrieval of emotional pictures sharing the same emotional valence than the picture initially associated
with the background picture. These results demonstrate that a neutral stimulus may acquire an emotional valence
as a result of its pairing with an emotional stimulus. They further show that these background pictures can subsequently
be used as primes to retrieve the specific emotional information or to retrieve emotionally congruent information,
depending on the length of the interval of retention. The latter phenomenon may be seen as an adaptive
process to facilitate a forthcoming response for which the emotional valence, but not the specific content, can be
anticipated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1499" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EMOTIONAL INFLUENCES ON DECISION MAKING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dolan</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1511" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EMOTION, ATTENTION, AND EPISODIC MEMORY</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>A.

For instance, the viewing of a gruesome roadside accident is at once both highly attention-grabbing and memorable.
This functional correlation is also supported by the neuroanatomy of emotional influences on attention and memory,
which highlight the common central role of the amygdala. That the amygdala is critical to both reflexive attention
to and later memory for emotional events suggests the emotional enhancement of memory (EEM) may depend upon
the emotional enhancement of attention (EEA) during initial encoding. In a series of studies we show that EEA and EEM
are behaviorally and neurally dissociable. We provide evidence demonstrating 1) that the reflexive recruitment of EEA
need not result in EEM; 2) the amygdala is involved in both EEA and EEM, but only the former recruits the hippocampal
formation, which correlates with EEM and 3) emotional events result in retrograde EEM for prior neutral events, suggesting
it is the altered consolidation of rather than attention to emotional events that resulting in long term EEM. In sum, these studies suggest that reflexive attention to and later memory for emotional events depend on dissociable neurocognitive processes, hypothetically reflecting the distinct contributions of the central and basolateral nuclei of the human amygdala.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1528" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S5: Neural representation of objects in the inferior temporal cortex</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

to these parameterized sets of shapes. In particular, we examined the relationship between physical shape similarity,
perceived shape similarity (as measured in psychophysical studies in humans and monkeys subjects) and the shape
tuning of single macaque IT neurons. I will demonstrate that, firstly, the response of IT neurons to various shapes depends
on shape similarity locally in shape space. Secondly, the IT response modulation that is obtained when varying shape correlatesmore strongly with perceived than with physical shape similarity. Thirdly, categorization learning significantly affects
the representation of shapes in IT such that the neurons respond more similarly to shapes belonging to the same than

Our goal is a mechanistic understanding of how the primate brain accomplishes this remarkable
feat. Specifically we seek to understand how sensory input is transformed from an initial neuronal population representation
(essentially a photograph on the retina), to a new, remarkably powerful form of population representation&#x02014;one
that can directly support object recognition. We are currently focused on patterns of neuronal activity in the highest levels
of the ventral visual stream (primate inferior temporal cortex, IT) that may directly underlie recognition. Understanding
the creation of the IT representation by transformations carried out along the ventral visual processing stream is the
key to understanding visual recognition. In this talk, I will review our results on the spatial and temporal ability of the
IT population representation for supporting position- and scale-tolerant recognition. Although several mechanistic hypotheses
may explain the remarkable tolerance properties of the IT representation, one of the most intriguing and unexplored
is the possibility that visual experience plays an important role in developing such tolerance. I will present results
from our ongoing studies aimed at testing this hypothesis using neurophysiology, human psychophysics, and monkey
fMRI. These studies illuminate the role of the IT representation in supporting visual object recognition, and provide
new constraints on the mechanisms that might produce that representation. Our goal is to use this understanding
to inspire artificial vision systems, to aid the development of visual prosthetics, to provide guidance to molecular approaches
to repair lost brain function, and to obtain deep insight into how the brain represents sensory information in

The distributed neuronal representation of object identity uses encoding based on the number
of spikes, with little contribution of stimulus-dependent synchrony, and with almost independent information conveyed
by different single neurons, so that the encoding capacity of the system is very high. A multistage feed-forward
architecture with convergence and competition at each stage is able to learn invariant representations of objects including
faces by use of a Hebbian synaptic modification rule which incorporates a short memory trace (0.5 s) of preceding activity.
This trace rule enables the network to learn the properties of objects which are spatio-temporally invariant over this
time scale. A new learning principle utilises continuous spatial transformations to compute invariant representations. It
has been found that in complex natural scenes, the receptive fields of inferior temporal cortex neurons shrink to approximately
the size of an object, and are centred on or close to the fovea. It is proposed that this provides a solution to reading
the output of the ventral visual system, for primarily the object that is close to the fovea is represented by inferior temporal
visual cortex neuronal activity. The effect is captured in models that use competition to weight the representation
towards what is at the fovea. Some inferior temporal cortex neurons in these conditions have asymmetric receptive fields
about the fovea, so that the location of the face with respect to the fovea, and multiple faces, can be represented in a scene.
The model has been extended to account for covert attentional effects such as finding the location of a target object in
a complex scene, by incorporating modules to represent the dorsal visual system, backprojections, and short term memory
networks in the prefrontal cortex to keep active the representation of the object of attention, and does not require
temporal synchronization to implement binding. The model has also been extended to a theory of how invariant global

Retinal responses vary quickly because they are very sensitive to saccades or object motion while representations in the inferior temporal cortex (IT) display
a large degree of invariance and therefore vary more slowly. Turning this argument around leads to slowness as a learning
principle. By learning input-output functions that generate slowly varying output signals, units become invariant
to frequently occurring transformations, such as translation, rotation, or illumination changes. We argue that this is an
effective mechanism by which IT could learn its invariant representations. Interestingly the same principle also leads
to a number of complex-cell receptive-field properties even though invariance does not seem to be such an issue so early
in the visual system. Some of the simulation results presented here are complemented by analytical results obtained with

However the underlying neurobiological mechanisms still remain elusive. In an effort to address this issue we employed two experimental paradigms as models of early experiences: A. &#x0201c;neonatal handling&#x0201d;, which is known to affect the programming of the stress response, and B. Spatial learning during the neonatal period using the mother as a positive or negative reinforcer. Neonatal handling affects both emotional and cognitive adult behavior, often in a sexual dimorphic manner. In males it has a beneficial effect,
providing them with a greater capacity to actively cope with chronic stressors, while in the females it increases their susceptibility
to express &#x0201c;depressive&#x0201d; behavior. A cellular correlate of these behavioral results is a handling-induced change
in 5HT1A receptors, with an increase in the males and a decrease in the females. Furthermore, in males handling results
in increased ability, as assessed by the Morris water maze, for spatial learning and memory after stress, while it has no such
effect in females. Handling results in increased GR and BDNF levels in males, and in the females it increases turnover in the
basal forebrain cholinergic system. In the second paradigm in which contact with the mother is used as either a positive
or a negative reinforcer, rat pups, both those denied contact (frustrated) and those allowed contact as continuous reward
(non-frustrated) learn a T-maze after four days of training (postnatal day 10&#x02013;13). Although, both experimental groups
acquire the spatial memory task, it appears that they employ different cognitive strategies, with non-frustrated rats following
procedural learning. On the other hand &#x0201c;frustrated&#x0201d; pups show increased activation of the hippocampus and in adulthood improved recall of spatial learning in the Morris water maze.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1740" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IMPACT OF PRE- AND POSTNATAL STRESS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF LIMBIC SYNAPTIC CIRCUITS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bock</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname> Braun</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Institute of Biology, Otto von Guericke University Magdeburg, Germany</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The way in which experience sculpts the developing neural circuitry is one of the most intriguing questions in developmental neurobiology. Recent evidence suggests that epigenetic factors affect the development of the brain and behaviour
in a much more pronounced way than was previously appreciated. However, the cellular mechanisms of
such experience-driven developmental events are far from understood. In particular, it is not clear in which way neural
changes induced by environmental factors are correlated with certain developmental time windows. Our studies reveal that stressful pre- and postnatal events dramatically influence neuronal development particularly in prefrontal and limbic
brain areas. We also found that the direction and magnitude of these dendritic and synaptic alterations is determined by
the developmental stage during which an adverse event is encountered. Moreover, the observed experience-induced neuronal
changes occur in a highly region- and sex-specific manner. In summary, our results indicate that the synaptic circuits
within prefrontal and limbic regions, which play a critical role in emotional regulation, learning and memory formation,
are adapted to the animal's pre- and early postnatal environment and therefore may shape the network capacities
for species-specific behavioural and cognitive functions in adolescence and adulthood.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1763" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HOW GENE AND ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS SHAPE BIOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL DEVELOPMENT

of decision making, using a range of mutually informative approaches from behavioral experiments, neurophysiology,
and functional neuroimaging. The present symposium adopts such a neuroeconomics perspective on decision making,
asking how humans and other animals represent values and consequently influence their choices. The orbitofrontal
cortex has important reciprocal connections with cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, thus appears to be at the
interface of emotion and cognition. Converging neuroscientific evidences show how the orbitofrontal cortex is involved
in representing the relative reward values (i.e., preferences), and the affective value of reinforcers, thus playing a fundamental
role in complex and adaptive behaviour. Lesions in this brain area determine severe impairments in individual
and social decision making. The symposium is aimed to discuss the unique and integrative role of the orbitofrontal cortex
in adaptive behaviour, reporting evidence across species based on the use of neurophysiological and neuroimaging
methodologies.

order to obtain rewards or avoid punishers. Yet, the underlying functional contribution of OFC that can lead to such
an impairment is still poorly understood. A key debate in the literature is whether orbitofrontal cortex is involved exclusively
in encoding associations between stimuli and rewarding outcomes (stimulus-outcome learning), or whether
this region is also involved in learning the relationship between an individual's own actions and the consequences of
those actions (response-outcome learning). The majority of single-unit neurophysiology studies have tended to support
the stimulus-outcome view, although some recent studies in rat OFC have found preliminary evidence for responseoutcome
coding. Here, I will present results from two human fMRI studies that directly address this issue. I will provide
evidence that neural activity in human OFC during instrumental responding for rewards is sensitive to the value
of the associated outcome, and to the contingency (or correlation) between an individual's responses and the outcomes
received, which together are the key behavioral characteristics of response-outcome learning. These data suggest that
human OFC, particularly its medial aspect guides rewardrelated behavior by virtue of encoding associations between
a specific action and its associated outcome.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1859" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ABSTRACT <break/>DECISION-MAKING AFTER FRONTAL LOBE INJURIES</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bechara</surname><given-names>Antoine</given-names></name></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>For a long time, the prefrontal cortex has been considered a &#x0201c;non-functional&#x0201d; brain area, and understanding its function has lagged behind nearly all other areas. This is no longer true since appreciation of the vital role that this brain region plays in adaptive behaviors, and especially decision-making, is now evident more than ever. This presentation is
to highlight the recent progress that has been made in this area of research. Decision-making is a term often referred
to in the psychological literature as one of the &#x0201c;executive functions&#x0201d;, which play a role in managing (like an executive) other cognitive functions, such as memory, attention, and language. Considerable research efforts have been directed
towards differentiating various processes of executive functions, but much of this effort in the past has focused on the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPC) sector. Here I will review findings that address decision-making and its link to the
ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPC). Decision-making impairments as encountered in neurological and psychiatric
patients are costly in terms of individual human suffering and in financial terms. In addition to its obvious value in
advancing fundamental knowledge in neuroscience, understanding the neural mechanisms of decision-making is likely
to have important practical consequences, including the understanding and management of neuropsychiatric disorders
such as addiction, as well as the management of a considerable number of elderly suffering from a decline in cognitive
functions critical for decision-making, in spite of relatively intact memory and general intellect, which impact real-life
matters that are important to themselves and their family.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1876" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE IMPACT OF TIME-DISCOUNTED REWARD ON NEURAL ACTIVITY IN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX AND

This behavior presumably requires them to form expectations for rewards and to detect when those expectations are violated. Evidence from recording studies suggests that orbitofrontal
cortex (OFC) is responsible for the former function, whereas the latter function is mediated by midbrain dopamine neurons
(DA). However few studies have examined the impact of time-discounted reward on these functions. We recorded
neurons fromrat VTA and OFC in a choice task during which we manipulated the relative value of the reward by changing
the size of or time to reward delivery over the course of several trial blocks. In each block, rats biased behavior towards
the more valued reward, i.e., short delays and large rewards. Consistent with the proposal that DA neurons signal prediction
errors, we found that reward-related activity of DA neurons in VTA increased significantly whenever the value
of the reward available increased and then declined as the rat learned to expect that reward. As neural responses to the rewards
waned, responses to odor cues predicting the more valued reward emerged. Signaling of prediction errors in individual
neurons was not modulated by response direction and co-varied with delay and reward size manipulations. This
pattern of signaling clearly differed from reward-related activity in OFC, which tended to develop as the rats learned to
expect reward. This was particularly evident when the timing of the reward changed; delay- selective OFC neurons showed
anticipatory and reward-related activity that strengthened during the block as the rats learned when to expect the delayed
reward. Additionally encoding of delayed reward in OFC was modulated by response direction and did not covary
with encoding of reward size. These data are consistent with the proposal that OFC maintains detailed information
about the current value of expected outcomes, whereas VTA signals when those expectations have been violated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1893" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ECONOMIC CHOICE AND THE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Padoa-Schioppa</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Department of Neurobiology, Harvard Medical School</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Economic choice is the behavior observed when individual select one of many available options solely based on subjective preferences. Behavioral evidence suggests that economic choice entails two mental processes: values are first assigned to the available options, and a decision is subsequently made between these values. With respect to the underlying brain
mechanisms, numerous reports show that lesions to the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) lead to choice deficits in various domains,
and imaging studies indicate that OFC activates when people make choices. In my talk, I will review evidence from
single cell recordings linking OFC more specifically to valuation. Individual neurons in OFC encode the value monkeys
assign to different beverages when they choose between them. These neurons encode economic value as a subjective
quantity, and they also reflect value transitivity. Most importantly, neurons in OFC encode economic value per se,
not as a modulation of sensory or motor processes. This trait distinguishes the value representation in OFC from that
observed in other brain areas. That OFC neurons encode economic value independently of visuomotor contingencies
has profound implications for possible psychological models of economic choice. It suggests that economic choice
is fundamentally choice between goods (&#x0201c;good-based&#x0201d; model) rather than choice between actions (&#x0201c;action-based&#x0201d; model).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1911" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S8: Episodic-like memory in animals</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

Exploration of a novel object leaves a complex memory trace akin to
human episodic memory. In rodents, episodic-like memory (ELM) can be inferred from behavior which indicates the remembrance
of the content (&#x0201c;what&#x0201d; kind of object was presented), place (&#x0201c;where&#x0201d; was this object placed) and temporal context (&#x0201c;when&#x0201d; was the object presented) after an unique episode. Most importantly, rodents behave as there is an interaction between temporal- and spatial information in their ELM, suggesting that they have established an integrated memory for unique experiences comprising &#x0201c;what&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;when&#x0201d; information. N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA-R) have been implicated in some forms of hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. The NMDA-R is well suited to associate multiple features of an event to represent an episode or event. We have asked whether NMDA-R modulation by d-cycloserine (DCS), a glycine-site agonist and cognitive enhancer, has promnestic effects on ELM under sub-optimal learning conditions, induced by either stress or pro/retroactive memory interference. Mild acute stress induced by an i.p. saline injection prior to the learning trials disturbed ELM in rats. DCS (15-mg/kg, i.p.) ameliorated this stress-induced deficit, but was not able to fully restore ELM. Using an experimental protocol designed to detect promnestic drug effects in mice, we found that DCS, can induce ELM under conditions where
animals regularly fail to establish an ELM. Mice treated with DCS (20-mg/kg, i.p.) both remembered the temporal order
in which two different objects have been encountered, their spatial position, and showed the predicted type of interaction
between temporal and spatial information typical for ELM. In conclusion, it appears that the NMDA-R is critically
involved in ELM formation in rodents. Supported by DFGgrants DE 1149/1-1 and DE 1149/1-2 to ED.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e1967" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CONTEXT-DEPENDENT OBJECT RECOGNITION MEMORY: ASSESSMENT OF AGE-RELATED MEMORY

hippocampus-dependent episodic recollection of items together with the contexts in which they occur (Aggleton &#x00026;
Brown, 1999). The recent development of tasks for rats that assess recognition of objects together with contextual information such as where they occurred, when they occurred, and in which context they occurred by the other
speakers in this session provide a useful tool for testing this idea. One prediction of the dual process model is the hippocampus
should be required for context-dependent, but not for context-independent recognition. To test this, we
have used the what, where and which task developed by Eacott and Norman (2004), which requires integrated memory
for objects, their spatial locations, and their background contexts, as well as a variety of control tasks. Large, bilateral
hippocampal lesions result in impaired performance on the OPC task, while leaving object recognition, object-place
(OP) recognition and object-context (OC) recognition intact. These data suggest that the hippocampus is not required
for all forms of context-dependent recognition memory, and that the OPC task may depend on hippocampusdependent
processes that are not required for recognition of object-place and object-context configurations. Therefore,
the underlying processes, rather than the information content per se, may determine whether the hippocampus
is required for recognition memory. I will then go on to describe the effects of discrete lesions of the CA1
and CA3 subfields of the hippocampus on performance of the these tasks. Our data suggest that the CA1 is required
for memory for integrated object-place-context information, whereas the CA3 region may play a less critical
role. These data will be discussed in the light of current theories of hippocampal contributions to episodic memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2024" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S9: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood: the Behaviour and the Neurobiology</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>
<italic>Organizers</italic>: Terje Sagvolden (University of Oslo, Norway) and Bob Oades (University Clinic of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Essen, Germany)</p><p>Recently, interdisciplinary investigations involving collaboration between clinical research and the basic neurosciences have thrown new light on the widespread developmental dysfunctions grouped together as childhood attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The high heritability of the disorder has been related to a number of features
defining monoaminergic function. In turn, the success of catecholaminergic medications and animal models
of various symptoms (e.g., in the spontaneously hypertensive rat) point not only to the neurochemical bases
underlying deficient attentional control and impulsivity in &#x0201c;hyperactive children,&#x0201d; but also crucially to their altered responsiveness to reinforcement (e.g., delay aversion). In parallel, indices of monoaminergic function have been related
in neuroimaging studies to the activation (or lack thereof) in patients' brain regions (e.g., the frontal lobes)
involved in important executive and reward functions. The addition of neurophysiological measures to such investigations
has helped illustrate the nature of the delayed developmental processes of potential etiological importance. Illustrating
the interactions beween these levels of analysis, an explanation of the underachievement of children with
ADHD in terms of their high intraindividual variability of response organization will be proposed; this is a theory
based on neuron-glia interactions. But we emphasize that recent and ongoing studies of these interdisciplinary interactions
will be illustrated in each of the four presentations.

reinforcement and extinction processes, as suggested by the recently published dynamic developmental theory
(DDT) of AD/HD. DDT argues that AD/HD is a basic neurobehavioural disorder, probably caused by dysfunctioning

AD/HD is a neurobiologically based disorder. Further, the data indicate that some of the intra-individual variability

<bold>Background</bold>. An ideal animal model should be similar to the disorder it models in terms of etiology, biochemistry, symptomatology, and treatment. Animal models provide several advantages over clinical research: simpler nervous systems, easily interpreted behaviors, genetic homogeneity, easily controlled environment, and a greater variety of interventions.
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a neurobehavioral disorder of childhood onset that is characterized
by inattentiveness, hyperactivity, and impulsiveness. Its diagnosis is behaviorally based; therefore, the validation of
an ADHD model must be based in behavior. An ADHD model must mimic the fundamental behavioral characteristics
of ADHD (face validity), conform to a theoretical rationale for ADHD (construct validity), and predict aspects
of ADHD behavior, genetics, and neurobiology previously uncharted in clinical settings (predictive validity).
Spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) fulfill many of the validation criteria and compare well with clinical cases of
ADHD.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>. ADHD-like behavior was tested with a visual discrimination task measuring overactivity, impulsiveness and inattentiveness. Gene expression was measured by extracting mRNA from the tissue and hybridising the mRNA sample to the 25-mer probes on Affymetrix GeneChips.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>. The SHR showed striking overactivity and poorer sustained attention. WKY and Sprague-Dawley rats showed a normal behavior. Wistar rats deviated significantly from the other control groups. Genetic analyses showed several
changes in monoamines as well as other systems. Discussion. The present results indicate that overactivity and impulsiveness
are caused by imbalances in other neuromodulators than those causing poor sustained attention. Behavioral
phenotyping of controls is essential in animal model studies of ADHD. WKY, but not Sprague-Dawley and Wistar rats,
are appropriate controls.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2179" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FUNCTIONAL IMAGING ABNORMALITIES IN ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER

and adolescents with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and show the effects of stimulant medication
on neural networks of cognitive functioning. The most consistent fMRI findings in ADHD have been a reduced
activation in predominantly right frontal and caudate brain regions during tasks of inhibitory and cognitive
control. Preliminary evidence from our cross-sectional functional imaging studies suggests that ADHD might be characterised
by a maturational delay of normal task-specific neurofunctional activation. Recent evidence from our and other
labs has in addition suggested more widespread functional abnormalities in ADHD in parietal and temporal brain regions
during visual-spatial attention functions. We will review these recent findings and show evidence that temporal
lobe abnormalities during attention allocation in ADHD is related to their typical behavioural abnormality of increased
intra-subject response variability. Lastly, the effects of the psychostimulant drug Methylphenidate will be shown
on brain activation in medication-nave ADHD children during several tasks of cognitive control. During all tasks,
Methylphenidate appears to enhance taskunspecific, generic striatal and cingulate neural networks that mediate attention
and motivation rather than normalising task-specific prefrontal brain abnormalities. Overall, the findings suggest
that ADHD is associated with a more immature recruitment not only of fronto-striatal brain regions during cognitive
control, but also of parieto-temporal brain regions in relation to typical behavioural features such as inattention and
behavioural dispersion. Furthermore, Methylphenidate does not normalise task-specific prefrontal abnormalities, but
seems to modulate cognitive functions by enhancing compensatory, generic and task-unspecific subcortical attention
networks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2208" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GLIA ENERGY SUPPLY: A NEURO-PHYSIOLOGICAL EXPLANATION FOR INTRA-INDIVIDUAL VARIABILITY

broad explanatory value. Symptoms are expressed often or frequently or pretty much and performance on laboratory
tests varies markedly over brief time periods (milliseconds to seconds).</p><p>A new explanation of the phenomenon suggests there is a deficiency of the energy supply to rapidly firing cortical
neurons1. Central to the mechanism may be the glutamate-stimulated lactate shuttle under astrocytic control and modulated
by monoaminergic input. In situations requiring continual responses to externally paced stimuli the rapid firing of
neurons must be maintained: but in ADHD, and in related conditions, there may be deficient ATP production, a slow
restoration of ionic gradients across neuronal membranes and delayed neuronal firing often resulting in the subject going
off-task. Further, the proposed insuffient glial supply of lactate may also affect CNS development on the time scale of
months to years. This deficiency in the oligodendrocytes may lead to impaired fatty acid synthesis and an uneven myelination
of axons as the children grow up. Reduced glycolysis and lactate supply can reflect under-stimulation of catecholamine
receptors and be moderated by current pharmacotheraputic strategies.</p><p>The hypothesis can be tested with neuroimaging (DTI), EEG recording (coherence), biochemical indicators (compromised
glial function) and animal models. The prevalence of genetic markers for factors that regulate energy
metabolism, astrocyte function and myelin synthesis should be investigated. If confirmed the relevant mechanisms offer a
range of new targets for genetic moderation and therapeutic intervention.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B7"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>VA</given-names></name><name><surname>Oades</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Tannock</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Response variability in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: a neuronal and glial energetics hypothesis</article-title><source><italic>Behavioral and Brain Functions</italic></source><year>2006</year><volume>2</volume><fpage>30</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16925830</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2263" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S10: Hippocampal/cortical interactions in spatial behaviors</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

This
is likely to rely on a distributed brain network where the medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) plays a central role. By recording
single units from MEC in behaving rats we have revealed a topographically organized neural map of the spatial environment
in MEC. The key unit of the map is the &#x02018;grid cell&#x02019; which fires selectively at multiple spatial locations
forming a triangular grid pattern spanning the surface of the environment. The map is anchored to external landmarks,
but persists in their absence, suggesting the grid cells may be part of a generalized, path-integration based map of
the spatial environment. Grids of neighbouring cells share a common orientation and spacing, but their vertex locations
are offset relative to each other. Grid cells show a topographic organization with grid spacing increasing from less
than 30 cm dorsally to several meters ventrally. Grid cells are found in all four principle cell layers of MEC and they intermingle
with head-direction cells in all layers except layer II. &#x02018;Conjunctive cells&#x02019; with conjoint head- direction
and grid cell properties exist in layers III to VI. Simultaneously recorded grid-, conjunctive- and head-direction cells
respond coherently to environmental manipulations, such as a rotation of the enclosure. Grid cells show a preserved temporal
and spatial firing relation to each other across environments. Simultaneously recorded grid cells at different locations
of MEC shift, rotate and expand in concert between environments even when grid spacing and grid orientation
are different. Our results imply that MEC operates as an integrated structure for accurate positional calculations. The
fact that realignments were similar between recording locations suggests that the entorhinal map may show a coherent
representation of space that extend across areas of different grid scales and grid orientations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2320" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ENTORHINAL GRID CELLS AND HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hafting</surname><given-names>T.

context- independent spatial map of the environment. The hippocampal place code is context specific and responds to
changes in the sensory or motivational input as either a full reorganization of the place code (global remapping), or as
a selective change of firing rates (rate remapping). To determine whether the hippocampal population response originates
within the hippocampus or upstream in the grid-cell network of the MEC, we recorded spike activity in these areas
under conditions that gave either global or rate remapping in the hippocampus. Global remapping in CA3 was always accompanied
by a coherent offset in the grid of simultaneously recorded MEC neurons. The strong temporal contiguity of
hippocampal remapping and entorhinal grid shifts suggests that the two phenomena are mechanistically related. During
rate remapping in CA3, grid cells in MEC showed no offset or rotation, and the firing rate distribution remained unaltered.
Thus, it is likely that rate remapping is of intrahippocampal origin. The entorhinal cortex and hippocampus have reciprocal
connections suggesting an integrated unit with bidirectional influence. It has been suggested that stored representations
in the hippocampus anchor the grid to the environment. Temporal inactivation of the hippocampus by
local infusion of muscimol dramatically reduced the firing frequency of grid cells, and the grid patterns almost vanished
from the time-averaged rate maps, while simultaneously recorded head-direction cells from layer III were not
affected. These results suggest that entorhinal grid fields are dependent on functional interactions with the hippocampus.
It remains to be elucidated, however, whether the hippocampal output exerts a general excitatory drive on the grid cells
or if grid stability depends on stored representations in the hippocampus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2337" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GOAL ENCODING IN PREFRONTAL CELLS AND HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Save</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l22">

The hippocampus is
thought to play a key role in this network because it contains place cells. Although place cells signal an animal's location,
an additional mechanism is needed to specify the animal's goal. However, whether and how the brain encodes goal location have not been demonstrated so far. The prefrontal cortex is a potential candidate to such a function since it has
been proposed to be involved in the organization of spatial behaviour and it receives a direct projection from the hippocampus.
To investigate this hypothesis, we recorded medial prefrontal cortex neurons from rats performing a continuous
place navigation task. In this task, rats had to locate an unmarked goal zone by using an environmental cue and
wait there for 2 s to trigger an overhead feeder. A single pellet was then released and could end anywhere in the arena
after dropping. The rat had to leave the goal zone and forage to retrieve the pellet. We found that a substantial proportion
of neurons in the prelimbic and infralimbic areas had firing fields. Prefrontal firing fields were larger and noisier
than place cell firing fields and were concentrated in explicit goal locations (goal zone, pellet-dropping zone). We
also recorded hippocampal place cells as rats performed the same task. We discovered that in addition to their main firing
field, place cells displayed a selective discharge while the rat was at the goal zone waiting for pellet release. Because
it was unlikely that such activity resulted from a specific behavioral state, we propose that this is a signal of the animal's
correct location at the goal. Overall, the results suggest that the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are involved and
cooperate in goal encoding.

structures of the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus. However, our group and others have demonstrated
previously that the hippocampal formation has a time-limited role in long-term memory storage, such that extrahippocampal
structures eventually become capable of independently supporting the retrieval of remote memories. In
other words, the hippocampus does not store remote memories, yet what happens beyond the hippocampus remains
unclear. This issue has been the subject of intense investigation and debate in the field of Cognitive Neuroscience, but to
date, no convincing evidence as to the identity, mechanisms and putative interactions between memory systems underlying
remote memory storage and retrieval have emerged. To address this issue, we have conducted brain imaging experiments
using (14C)2-deoxyglucose mapping and analyses of changes in expression of activity-dependent genes in
mice submitted to recent and remote spatial memory testing. Our findings show that memory processing initially requires
a hippocampal-cortical dialogue, ultimately enabling structured cortical networks to mediate recall of remote memories.
Morphological changes, including the synthesis of novel synapses in cortical networks also occurs as memories progressively
mature. However, the neocortex does not simply serve as a passive storage site but is also able to actively integrate
new memories depending on the organisation and status of pre-existing knowledge. The prefrontal cortex in
particular may play a crucial role in integrating information from distributed cortical networks and modulating hippocampal
activity during memory recall. These findings will be discussed in the context of current models of memory
consolidation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2415" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S11: New insights in the development of cortical netwarks</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

One type has a thick apical dendrite extending into layer I with a prominent terminal tuft, produces distinctive initial bursts of action potentials
in response to current injection and projects out of the telencephalon to the superior colliculus, pontine nuclei
and spinal cord. The other type has a slender apical dendrite which does not reach layer I, arborises in layers II-IV without
a terminal tuft, does not burst, and projects to other cortical areas, including the contralateral hemisphere. These neurons
are generated at similar times, and with the exception of their projections, are initially indistinguishable, having tufted apical
dendrites reaching layer I and no bursting firing pattern. Towards the end of the first postnatal week the corticocortical
cells selectively lose their apical tufts (Koester and O'Leary, 1992) and it is not until 14 days postnatally that the first corticotectal cells develop the burst-firing characteristic (Kasper et al., 1994; Christophe et al., 2005). Our experiments aimed
at detecting and characterizing causal relationships between target finding, somatodendritic differentiation, physiological
specification and gene expression patterns using the different layer V projection neurons in the rodent as a model system.</p><p>Previous and recent studies have isolated molecules which serve as molecular markers for layer V neurons; Otx-
1, a transcription factor expressed in layers V/VI, specific to type I (Frantz et al., 1994; Weimann et al., 1999); SMI-32,
N200 and FNP-7 which are neurofilaments only expressed in type I neurons (Voelker et al., 2004); ER81, an ETS transcription
factor expressed in both neuronal cells types (Hevner et al., 2003; Yoneshima et al., 2005); Lmo4, a LIM domain-containing
protein known to be expressed in layers II/III and V (Bulchand et al., 2003) which is a specific marker for type
II neurons (Arlotta et al., 2005); CTIP2, a gene of unknown function specifically expressed in layer V type I neurons (Arlotta
et al., 2005).</p><p>Co-localisation studies onOtx-1 and ER81 suggested that the two markers are not expressed within the same postnatal
layer V neurons; moreover ER81 is also expressed in some type II layer V pyramidal neurons (Hevner et al., 2003;
Yoneshima et al., 2005). Although ER81 and N200 have been shown to label type I projection neurons in layer V, recent
co-localisation studies suggests that the two molecules are not co-expressed within the same cells (Rolph et al. 2005).
Retrograde labelling and immunohistochemistry for the two markers revealed that although ER81 and N200 both expressed
in type I layer V neurons, they are never coexpressed in the same projection neurons, suggesting that there are at
least two distinct neurochemical subpopulations within type I layer V pyramidal cells (Rolph, et al., 2005; A. Cheung, C.
Voelker, R. Rolph, T. Jessell and Z. Molnar unpublished observations). An important aim of these studies is to be able
to unify molecular classification with other aspects of layer V neuronal classification in adult and during development. Potential molecular markers for layer V neurons are continually being found and the correlation of these markers to other aspects
of neuronal phenotype will not only result in a more comprehensive classification of layer V projection neurons,
but also in the better understanding of the genetic and epigenetic programs of cortical neuronal differentiation and cortical
circuit formation.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>This work was supported by the Human Frontier Science Program (RG 107/200) and MRC.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2487" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DEVELOPMENT AND PLASTICITY OF CORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vercelli</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Department of Anatomy, Pharmacology and Forensic Medicine, University of Torino, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Pyramidal neurons represent the 70% of cortical neurons, and are different from each other for laminar position, pattern of projection, morphological and electrophysiological features. Their development depends on genetic and epigenetic factors, and developmental errors can lead to diseases such as epilepsy and mental retardation. A subpopulation of pyramidal neurons lose their apical dendrite at the end of development and gives origin to spiny stellate neurons. Another
one is characterized by a shortened apical dendrite, whereas others by a long apical dendrite reaching the first cortical
layer. Rho-GTPases are involved in pyramidal neuron development. In particular, Citron K is involved in cytokinesis and
in the development of dendritic arborisation, whereas Citron N is involved in spine formation. Genetic manipulation
of their genes can lead to gross alterations in pyramidal neurons and their dendrites. Pyramidal neurons are dependent
on their laminar position and on local factors in their dendritic arborisation, and pyramidal neurons projecting to different
targets differ for morphology and electrophysiology. They participate in the vertical organisation of cerebral cortex
in modules, both in cortical columns and minicolumns. Minicolums are conserved through species, individuals and
cortical areas, but their composition is multifarious. They are characterized by groups of pyramidal neurons located
in different cortical layers whose apical dendrites bundle together: they possibly reflect aspects of neuronal neurogenesis,
and are elctrophysiologically linked by gap junctions in the early phases of cortical development. Pyramidal neurons
in the same dendritic bundle send axons which fascicle together, and project to the same target, either cortical or subcortical.
The organisation of minicolumns therefore is targetrelated. It is disrupted in several diseases such as autism and
Alzheimer disease. Support: Compagnia di San Paolo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2504" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CELL INTERACTIONS INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF FUNCTIONAL MODULES IN THE CEREBELLAR

its function in GI differentiation in the cerebellum. By comparing the generation of parvalbumin labeled

in an uneven distribution or a regional modulation of the functional properties of the GI.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Supported by CNRS/ENS, University of Torino, Development journal travel fellowship, ARC fellowship.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2585" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SPECIFICATION AND INTEGRATION OF INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS IN THE CEREBELLAR CORTEX</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rossi</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Department of Neuroscience, University of Turin, I-10126 Turin, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The different neuronal phenotypes that populate the cerebellar cortex are generated according to a precise spatiotemporal schedule, in which projection neurons precede local interneurons. Glutamatergic neurons develop from the rhombic lip, whereas GABAergic types originate from the ventricular neuroepithelium. Progenitors in these germinal layers
are committed towards specific phenotypes already at early ontogenetic stages. Transplantation experiments show
that postnatally proliferating precursors exposed to the heterochronic environment of the embryonic cerebellar primordium
are unable to adopt the identities of projection neurons (Purkinje cells or deep nuclei neurons), suggesting
that the sequence of phenotype generation results from the progressive restriction of progenitor cell developmental potential.
GABAergic interneurons derive from a subset of ventricular zone cells, which migrate in the white matter and
proliferate up to postnatal life. During this period, different interneuron categories are produced according to an insideout
sequence, from the deep nuclei to the molecular layer. Progenitors for these interneurons heterochronically transplanted
to embryonic or postnatal cerebella achieve a high degree of integration in the recipient cortex and deep nuclei,
and acquire GABAergic interneuron phenotypes appropriate for the host age and engraftment site. Therefore, contrary to
other cerebellar types, which derive from fate-restricted precursors, GABAergic interneurons are produced by a common
pool of progenitors, which maintain their full developmental potentialities up to late ontogenetic stages and adopt mature
identities in response to local instructive cues. In this way, the numbers and types of inhibitory interneurons can be set
by spatio-temporally patterned signals in order to match the functional requirements of developing cerebellar circuits.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Supported by MURST, Regione Piemonte, University of Turin, Compagnia di San Paolo</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2608" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>S12: GABA, the Amygdala, and Mood and anxiety disoredrs</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>

To increase Allo brain levels, we administered the S-isomers of the selective
brain steroidogenic stimulants (SBSS) FLX and NFLX, which are several-fold more potent than their respective Risomers
in upregulating Allo brain levels (PNAS 101: 6222, 2004). The EC50 of S-FLX (0.80 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/kg s.c.) and S-NFLX

At concentrations that failed to inhibit serotonin reuptake but increased neurosteroid biosynthesis, S-FLX (0.5 to 1.9 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/kg s.c.) and S-NFLX (0.09 to 0.9 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/kg s.c.) administered to SI mice reduced by 30&#x02013;40% the duration of contextual fear to an electro-shock stimulus (3 shocks at 2 mA delivered 24 hrs before the test) and the intensity of aggressiveness. Hence, these effects are related to neurosteroid biosynthesis and not to serotonin reuptake. Further, in group-housed mice, we depleted Allo levels by 60 to 80% in the hippocampus, amygdala, olfactory bulb, and frontal cortex by administering 10 to 80 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/kg s.c. of the potent selective 5.-RI inhibitor (17beta)-17-[bis (1-methylethyl) amino carbonyl)] androsta-3,5diene-3-carboxylic acid (SKF 105,111).

These pharmacological manipulations of neurosteroid biosynthesis may allow the identification of inhibitory synaptic circuits directly linked to fear and aggression.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2731" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MOLECULAR VIEW ON GABAERGIC FUNCTION IN THE AMYGDALA&#x02014;RELEVANCE TO ANXIETY AND

processing in the amygdala and the control of affective behaviour. These neurons comprise a highly heterogeneous
population of cells further characterised by the expression of particular neuropeptide co-transmitters and
specific neuromodulatory innvervation. Although together accounting only for 10&#x02013;20% of the total neuron population in the amygdala, GABAergic interneurons exert a profound control over the activity of amygdala projection neurons,
information flow within the amygdala and its integration in extended network activity patterns. We employed a combination of molecular, behavioural and system physiology approaches to identify gene products that are involved
in control of such emotions through the GABAergic interneurons in the amygdala, and to characterise their contribution
to cellular and network processes underlying affective behaviours. In particular, we investigated the role of the
key enzyme in GABA synthesis, glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), as well as neuropeptide co-transmitter in GABAergic
neurons, such as somatostatin, in these processes. Firstly, gene expression analysis indicated a involvement of these factors

GABAergic system in the amygdala, as well as the expression of anxiety-like and mood-related behaviours. And thirdly, in

stages. We have shown before that Juvenile stress impairs coping behavior in adulthood. The present study examined
the short and long-term effects of Juvenile stress on GABAA subunit expression in both the amygdala and hippocampus.
At juvenileness (d 26-28), either elevated platform stress or variable stress were applied. The open field, startle response

We recently defined the thalamic dopaminergic
system in primates using immunohistochemistry against dopamine and the dopamine transporter (DAT) in monkey
and human brains, as well as neural tracing studies in monkey brains. The system arises from numerous dopaminergic
cell groups in the hypothalamus and brainstem, and selectively targets numerous thalamic nuclei. The most densely
innervated are the midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei, and the ventral
lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. The rat dorsal thalamus holds only sparse dopamine innervation; it is mainly located in the mediodorsal, paraventricular, ventral medial, and ventral lateral nuclei. The reticular nucleus is notably innervated in both primates and rats. The main targets of DAT-expressing axons in the macaque mediodorsal nucleus
are thalamic interneurons as revealed by ultrastructural analysis. Perhaps the marked expansion of the dopamine innervation
in the primate versus the rodent thalamus is related to the presence of a sizable interneuron population in the
primate. Considering the distribution of dopaminergic axons in the primate thalamic nuclei, we propose that thalamic
dopamine may play a role in attention, emotion, cognition, sleep regulation, complex somatosensory and visual processing,
and motor control. The thalamic dopaminergic system could also be related to the pathophysiology of Parkinson's
disease and schizophrenia, and may be a relevant site of action for some drugs of addiction.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>Supported by SAF2005-05380; MEC, Spain.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2911" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TONIC AND PHASIC DOPAMINE SYSTEM REGULATION OF INFORMATION FLOW</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Grace</surname><given-names>A.

space in the striatum, and a rapid, high amplitude intrasynaptic phasic release. Our data show that the tonic DA system
is dependent on the population activity of the DA neuron population, which is the proportion of spontaneously
firing DA neurons that is controlled by a pathway originating in the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus. In contrast,
the phasic DA release is determined by burst firing of DA neurons in response to behaviorally salient stimuli; this
response is regulated by glutamatergic afferents from the pedunculopontine tegmentum that innervate ventral tegmental
DA neurons. Our studies have shown that the tonic and phasic dopamine system work together to regulate information
flow within the nucleus accumbens. Thus, tonic DA is found to selectively inhibit prefrontal cortical afferent input
to the accumbens via D2 receptor stimulation, whereas phasic DA preferentially increases limbic ventral subicular inputs
via a D1-mediated process. Therefore, increases in tonic and phasic DA release would shift information flow away from
prefrontal cortical drive and towards a limbic predominance. Such a shift is reflected in the behavior of the animal, with
disruption of phasic limbic drive interfering with acquiring a task, and disruption of tonic prefrontal cortical input leading
to perseverative behavior. Repeated cocaine treatment was found tomimic the effects of limbic predominance, which we
propose underlies the focus on drug-seeking behavior while interfering with the ability of the prefrontal cortex to switch
to more behaviorally effective strategies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e2952" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MOTOR AND BEHAVIORAL CONSEQUENCES OF ABNORMAL DOPAMINERGIC STIMULATION IN

include schizophrenia and psychosis, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome and restless leg syndrome. However, direct proof
of DAergic dysfunction is only available for Parkinson's disease(PD). Here, neuronal degeneration of dopamine (DA)
cells in the substantia nigra is associated with profound reduction of striatal dopamine. Replacement of such deficit
with levodopa is associated with very high levels of intracerebral DA levels eventually giving rise to excessive DAergic
stimulation. Patients with PD represent therefore, an opportunity to study the consequences of two extreme situations,
i.e., severe DAergic deficit and excessive DA availability. The former (i.e., untreated PD) is associated with reduced movement

PD) leads to excessive involuntary movements or dyskinesias, behavioral abnormalities and psychosis.</p><p>These different clinical expressions mediated by changes in DA availability probably represent activation of several

Following the discovery in 1938 of the enzyme dopa decarboxylase and the demonstration that in
animal tissues this enzyme catalyzed the formation of DA from the amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA),
DA was assigned the role of an intermediate metabolite in the biosynthesis of noradrenaline and adrenaline in the
body. In 1957 the occurrence of DA in the mammalian, including human, brain was discovered. In 1959 DA was
shown to be highly concentrated in the nuclei of the basal ganglia. This striking localisation, together with earlier observations
by various authors showing that the DA precursor L-DOPA caused motor overactivity, antagonized the reserpine &#x0201c;tranquilization&#x0201d;, increased brain catecholamine levels, and replenished the brain DA depleted by reserpine,
suggested that DA might be involved in the basal ganglia control of movement and the &#x0201c;reserpine parkinsonism&#x0201d;. Combining these various data into a single concept, in 1959 a
study of DA in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) was started in Vienna, demonstrating in 1960 a severe
striatal DA deficit, specific for PD. This discovery led directly to the DA replacement concept with L-DOPA and in 1961
to the first highly successful clinical trials with L-DOPA in PD patients. In 1963 the DA deficit in the PD substantia nigra
was demonstrated, paving the way for studies on the existence of the nigrostriatal DA pathway and the recognition
that the loss of nigral DA neurons was the cause of the striatal DA deficit in PD. Although brain DA's path to recognition
was not always smooth, today it is generally recognized that the DA/L-DOPA/PD story is one of the greatest success

In particular, multisensory experiences enrich our memories, despite only single-trial exposure, and influence
ongoing sensory processes at extremely early latencies in areas traditionally considered unisensory in their function.
Multisensory experiences are registered by the brain even when of no immediate behavioral relevance and can
be used to categorize ongoing experiences. Episodic and semantic factors contributing to this efficacy are likewise discussed

about the body, and about peripersonal space, directly influences proprioceptive and tactile representations. Body and
space in the brain are inherently multisensory.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>Supported by: Wellcome Trust Doctoral Studentship; Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851, Science Research

coherent percept. Neurophysiological and functional imaging studies have revealed multi-sensory interactions in a
widespread neural system encompassing subcortical structures, putative &#x02018;unisensory&#x02019; and higher order association cortices. Combining fMRI and psychophysics, we investigated where and how different types of sensory features are combined within the cortical hierarchy. We presented subjects with object pictures and sounds while factorially manipulating
the relative informativeness of the auditory and visual modalities. While low level spatio-temporal interactions
were found within Heschl's gyrus, higher order object features were integrated within the superior temporal sulci
(STS) bilaterally. Consistent with the law of inverse effectiveness, the multisensory interactions in STS were primarily
suppressive for intact, but (super)additive for degraded stimuli. These distinct modes paralleled behavioral indices
of multi-sensory enhancement showing the greatest multisensory benefit for degraded stimuli. In conclusion, the human
brain integrates information that is abstracted from its sensory inputs atmultiple levels of the cortical hierarchy. The
operational mode of audio-visual integration is dictated by the informativeness of the auditory and visual modalities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3099" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION IN EARLY AUDITORY CORTEX</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kayser</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Max-Planck-Institute for Biological Cybernetics</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>An increasing body of literature from functional imaging, electrophysiology and anatomy provides compelling evidence that merging of sensory information not only occurs in higher association areas, but also in lower sensory regions.
To investigate early cross-modal interactions in detail, we use the macaque auditory cortex as model and employ
a combination of high-resolution imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiological recordings. In the imaging data, few voxels
respond to non-auditory stimulation alone, but many show cross-modal interactions in the form of supra-linear
enhancement; i.e., the multimodal response exceeds the linear superposition of the unisensory responses. This effect is
reliably found at the caudal end and along the lateral side of the secondary auditory cortex, and can be localized to the
medial and caudal belt and caudal parabelt regions. This interaction obeys the classical rules for sensory integration: it
occurs only for temporally coincident stimuli and follows the principle of inverse effectiveness (integration is stronger
for less effective stimuli). Complementary electrophysiological recordings demonstrate that the imaging results are nicely
paralleled by similar findings in the low frequency local field potentials. Individual neurons, however, often show the opposite
effect and exhibit a decreased response when a visual stimulus is presented simultaneously with a sound. This
audio-visual depression occurs with a time lag of about 40&#x02013;80 ms, and for a wide range of simplistic and naturalistic stimuli.</p><p>Altogether, our results clearly support the notion that early sensory cortices are susceptible to modulation by different
senses. However, for individual neurons these effects are subtle and can be better detected at the level of population
responses. Future studies need to resolve where exactly this cross-modal input originates and how it aids the auditory
system to segregate our complex acoustical environment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3118" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>POSTERS <break/> Theme A: Sensory &#x00026; motor systems <break/> SPATIOTEMPORAL CLASSIFICATION OF FACIAL EXPRESSION AND IDENTITY REPRESENTATIONS USING HIGH-RESOLUTION IMAGING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Furl</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l31">

And how does experience with a category
change this representation? Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of visual coding predominantly rely
on mass-univariate general linear models (GLMs) to identify regions where localised activations show domain-specific
preferences for categories such as faces, nonface body parts, places, objects. In contrast, distributed activation patterns
whose profiles accurately discriminate visual categories have been identified by a growing number of studies. We discriminated
distributed brain activity patterns corresponding to facial identity and expression categories using multivariate pattern
classification (often characterised as &#x0201c;mental state decoding&#x0201d;). At high resolution (1.5 mm isotropic voxel size),
we scanned the ventral stream as participants viewed blocks of faces. For each block, one of seven identities was repeated
(while expressions and viewpoints changed) or one of seven expressions was repeated (while identities and viewpoints
changed). Ventral stream regions (including the fusiform gyrus) showed adaptation selective to repetitions of either
expression or identity categories, indicating category information in the temporal response dynamics. We capitalised
on such category-selective dynamics associated with adaptation by using a spatiotemporal multivariate classifier, which
uses both spatial and temporal information.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This article was partially support by Human Frontier RGP0047/2004-C.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3189" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FUNCTIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE VISUAL CORTEX DURING ANTICIPATORY

properties reflect an internal model of the statistical structure of the environment, and can thus be derived or learnt from
the structure and parameters of a statistical model of sensory observations, following the Helmholtzian notions of perception
as an inferential process. Here, we present a generative model of visual input based on the fundamental coupling between
the identity of an object or feature and its attributes. In our model, observations are generated from a set of binary
identity variables, representing the presence of a visual feature.</p><p>The appearance of each feature is modelled by amanifold that represents its episodic pose, and is parametrised by a set
of attribute variables.</p><p>When the model is applied to natural videos, the resulting attribute manifolds are spanned by a small set of Gabor
wavelets with similar position, orientation, and frequency, but with different phase.</p><p>The activity of attribute variables thus resembles that of simple cells in the primary visual cortex (V1). Identity variables
indicate the presence of a feature irrespective of its position on the underlying manifold, and are therefore insensitive
to the phase of the input. Their behaviour is thus similar to that of complex cells. The properties of the variables' receptive
fields are found to be consistent with physiological data from V1.</p><p>This generative model makes explicit an interpretation of complex and simple cells as elements in the segmentation
of a visual scene into independent features along with a parametrisation of their episodic appearance. It also indicates
their possible role in a hierarchical system that extracts progressively higher-level contents, starting from simpler,
low-level features.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3362" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FORGETTING RATE OF TOPOGRAPHICAL KNOWLEDGE IN HUMANS IN ABSENCE OF RECONSOLIDATION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Latini</surname><given-names>C.

Route knowledge corresponds to the memory trace of the sequence of landmarks encountered along a specific route, while survey knowledge allows
direct access to the global layout of an environment. In normal humans, the few available data on the retention of topographical
memory show no systematic decline over months or years. In the present experiment, two groups of participants
elaborated route and survey knowledge during navigation in the same complex virtual environment before performing
two route tasks (estimating the number of turns and the route distance between landmarks) and two survey tasks
(pointing to unseen landmarks and estimating the straightline distance between landmarks). Both groups were tested
immediately after learning and three months later, while one group was also tested one week and one month later (repeated
testing). Following the first testing session, performance was similar in both groups. On subsequent sessions,
while performance of the repeated tested group remained stable, it decreased significantly in the nonrepeated tested
group, especially on route tasks. Survey knowledge was more resistant to decay probably because of its abstract structure.
These data are the first to reveal a substantial and selective decline of topographical memory in humans, occurring only
if there is no possibility to reactivate knowledge along successive testing phases, that is, in the absence of reconsolidation.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by a post-doctoral grant from the Universit&#x000e0; degli Studi di Torino and from the Fondazione

Thus,
repetitive stimulation often induces adaptation to the stimulus and a decreased response. On the other hand, in an
awake animal, previous exposure to stimuli may vary how that stimulus is experienced: it can be attended, feared, highly
expected or neglected according to its acquired meaning. To what extent does this higher processing of a simple stimulus
alter the responses of single-neuron primary sensory cortices? In order to answer this question and to characterize
how repetitive stimulation shapes auditory cortical responses, we recorded from A1 and A2 in awake behaving
rats. Recordings were obtained with chronically implanted tetrodes that allowed us to identify the recordings of up to 5-6
single units simultaneously. To study adaptation, two identical white noise stimuli were delivered with different intervals
ranging from 50 ms to 8 s. Single neuron's recording revealed that the response to a sound is influenced by sounds delivered
even seconds earlier, the second one usually yielding a weaker response (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig94-1">Figure 1</xref>). Adaptation occurred mainly
in two time scales: one of hundreds of ms and another one of seconds (&#x0003c;10 s), the time course of adaptation and its recovery being determined by the intensity of the first stimulus of the pair. Our results suggest that adaptation to repetitive
stimulation does not differ from the one that can be evoked with similar protocols in other preparations of the auditory
cortex, therefore it seems to depend strictly on bottom-up mechanisms. On the other side, we have observed modulation
of auditory responses depending on the preceding sequence of sounds and thus the expectancy of certain stimuli.
We hypothesize that the activation of top-down mechanisms is underlying this phenomenon. </p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work was supported by the EU 6th FET project PRESENCCIA, Contract N 27731.</p></ack></back><floats-group><fig id="fig94-1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="NP2007-23250.002"/></fig></floats-group></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3489" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EXPLORING THE F-DTI HYPOTHESIS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Garbin</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is an MR technique that allows the visualisation the white matter bundles by identifying
the free mean path directions of the molecules of water in the brain volume. In functional MRI (fMRI), the different
behaviour of oxy-haemoglobin and deoxy-haemoglobin in a magnetic field is used to identify functional areas
on the brain cortex. The two techniques can be applied separately on a same subject to identify the white matter bundles
that connect separated functional areas on the cortex. Nevertheless, using this combination of the two techniques
gives as result a certain number of bundles and does not allow to identify which fibers of the white matter are indeed
responsible for signal transportation during a specific task. A different approach in integrating fMRI and DTI may be
found in a technique to show the activity in the white matter bundles rather than in the vessels near the target neurons.
In this work, the hypothesis of obtaining fMRI-like activations from DTI acquisitions is explored. Indeed, fMRI
takes into account blood oxygenation variations, while DTI is a technique to measure the behaviour of the molecules
of water in an anisotropic mean. The presented hypothesis comes from the consideration that the action potentials
that are generated during a specific task may affect the mean diffusivity of water molecules in the axons, and this
may be revealed by a confrontation of images of fractional anisotropy obtained with a normal DTI protocol as if the
images belonged to an fMRI session. This communication refers to two experimental MR-DTI acquisitions and postacquisition
processing that used the same algorithms that compete to fMRI. The two experiments were made using
a 1.5T tomograph and two different stimuli: in both cases, the correlation of the fractional anisotropy images with an
event-related time pattern shows at least one identified variation in the white matter response near the interested cortical
area.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3506" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PERCEPTUAL GROUPING IN FISH: GLOBAL AND LOCAL VISUAL PROCESSING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Frassine</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l35">

dimensions so that the testing images would differ minimally. Results showed that chicks are able of discriminating between
familiar and novel objects on the basis of their cast shadows and revealed that the motion of the solid stimuli affects
this process, being crucial for discrimination of stimuli that differ minimally. In Experiment III, test stimuli were point-of-light patterns moving coherently and producing the perception of a solid shape only when in motion. In these conditions,
it seems that chicks were not able to recognise the familiar solid, probably because of the high level of generalisation
required by test stimuli which had lost all features of their corresponding solids. For this reason, in Experiment
IV, chicks were imprinted and tested with point-light displays. Results suggested that chicks can discriminate the two
test stimuli from one another. In conclusion, it seems that domestic chickens, at a very early stage of development, are
able to recognise familiar objects by 2D impoverished stimuli. Such recognition is sensitive to fine differences whenever
motion cues are provided (i.e., stimuli rotation, which allows temporal integration of the different visual perspectives).
Moreover, chicks showed being able of object recognition from point-light displays requiring the sheer extraction

rat were obtained and the response to a puff of air delivered to the whiskers adjusted to evoke a response of
40&#x02013;100 microV (extracellular) and 2&#x02013;10 mV (intracellular). Lidocaine was locally applied in different forms (cream, local injection, aerosol, liquid drop) and concentrations (2&#x02013;10%). The response to an air puff (3&#x02013;10 ms) delivered to the whiskers was averaged over 50&#x02013;60 trials (5s ISI) in 16 rats. Local application of lidocaine induced a decrease in the evoked response amplitude (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig98-1">Figure 1</xref>). Even when local injection of lidocaine induced blockade of the responses, we ruled out this form of application since an injection at the snout may be stressful for an awake animal. The application of a liquid drop of lidocaine (0.4 ml, 10%) was found to induce a reliable blockade, which a recovery time of 3&#x02013;5 hours. The decrease in the response was a constant proportion of the sensory evoked amplitude. To conclude, topical application of liquid lidocaine applied at whiskers base can induce a temporary, reliable and reversible deprivation of whisker information. This approach can therefore be used to investigate the role of whisker information and the short term plasticity induced by its deprivation. Preliminary results indicate that this sensory deprivation has an impact on the integration of whisker information in other cognitive processes in awake animals.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by EU 6th FET PRESENCCIA n 27731.</p></ack></back><floats-group><fig id="fig98-1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>(a) Absolute value of local field potential amplitude in barrel cortex (one point represents 60 responses).

of perceptive threshold, as reflected by a decrease of reaction time and better performance in sensori-motor tasks.
While such effects have been largely reported for human subjects in auditory-visual recognition tasks, few data are
available in behaving monkeys engaged in similar protocols. Multisensory integration is believed to take place mainly in
higher order cortical areas. On a behavioral point of view, we have investigated the interaction between auditory and visual
stimuli in monkeys. Moreover, the present study aimed at exploring the mechanisms underlying multisensory integration
at the level of single neuron during a multisensory motor task in a cortical region considered as unimodal, a dimension
that cannot be assessed in human subjects. Two adult macaque monkeys were trained to execute a visuo-auditory
detection task. The animals had to generate a motor response in a reaction time paradigm whenever a visual, an auditory
or a visuo-auditory signal was presented. By varying the intensity of the individual auditory and visual stimuli we have
observed that, near threshold, the bimodal condition had a significant facilitatory effect on reaction times and stimulus
detection; this effect disappeared at higher intensities. Electrophysiological recordings were derived from single neurons
in the auditory cortex and adjacent zones in the posterior bank of the lateral sulcus. Different types of neuronal responses
were observed. Some neurons responded only to auditory stimuli whereas, somewhat surprising, other neurons
in the auditory cortex were influenced also by visual stimuli. The auditory cortex contains neurons which respond both
to auditory and visual stimuli, confirming other recent studies which suggest that multisensory convergence can occur at
low cortical level.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by Swiss National Science Foundation (No. 310000-110005).</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3708" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SUPERIOR OCCIPITAL LOBE IS INVOLVED IN PLANNING OF REACHING MOVEMENTS:

suggest a role of SOL in very early planning of reaching movements. It could be involved in target/movement

for accurate motor performance. Some studies suggested that both gaze and manual tracking systems are driven by a common
command signal. However, it has never been demonstrated that a motor plan for the arm is produced even when
the object is tracked by the eyes alone. By applying TMS to the motor cortex, we show for the first time that ocular tracking
is linked to changes in the excitability of the corticospinal system (CSS) of the relaxed upperlimb, as estimated from the
amplitude of the motor evoked potentials recorded in contralateral hand and wrist muscles. Subjects had to track with
the eyes a target moving at a constant velocity of 10&#x000b0;/s along the horizontal meridian. During each trial, single-pulse TMS
was randomly delivered either 100 ms before target motion or during the smooth pursuit (SP) eye movement, triggered
by the EOG signal at gaze eccentricities of 5&#x000b0;, 10&#x000b0; or 15&#x000b0;. Changes in excitability consisted in an overall inhibition of the arm CSS, which was modulated in a highly specific manner in the different muscles, depending on the direction of SP eye movements. The observed modulation in CSS excitability was found to be compatible with a motor plan encoding an aiming movement of the hand towards the same target tracked by the eyes. In addition, excitability changes are contingent upon upper-limb posture, as they are present only with a pronated forearm, but not with a supinated hand position.
Results demonstrate that, if the arm is held in a congruent postural configuration, tracking a moving object always
entails a coordinated motor plan, which involves both gaze and hand movements. Active inhibitory mechanisms are
activated in order to prevent an overt arm movement, whenever a manual tracking is not requested. Our data provide
strong evidence in favour of the existence of a common drive to both eye and hand tracking systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3801" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL DYNAMICS ON THE CONTROL OF THE REACHING MOVEMENT</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bertogna</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l41">

Although significant achievements in characterizing processes and structures of the reaching movements, the degree to which visually-directed movements are planned
and controlled during execution is still matter of debate. Recent studies have indicated that the motor plan, assembled
prior to the onset of movement, does not unfold unaltered but is updated continuously by internal feedback loops. This
study aimed at evaluating the temporal and spatial dynamics of such cerebral network during the control of a reaching
movement by the recording of event-related potentials (ERPs) in 9 healthy subjects performing a typical targetshift
task. Subjects were asked to reach and touch a spot in the centre of a touchscreen. Just after movement onset, the target
could stay in the same position or shift either at 20% or 40% of the total reaching trajectory (SHIFT condition).
The target could randomly shift towards one of six other positions, 3 for right and 3 for left hemifield. NO-SHIFT
condition represented the control condition. The analysis of the event-related dynamics showed a &#x0201c;phase-resetting&#x0201d; phenomenon of alpha, beta1 and beta2 bands, just after the shift of the target. The early phase synchronization was evident on shift condition for both hemifields and for both shift delays. It was absent on the control condition. From source analysis, it emerged a multiple synchronized activity of the fronto-parieto-occipital network, a constant activation of posterior regions during all the task and a controlateral involvement of motor regions with regard to the shift direction. Data show a strong parallel activation of fronto-parieto-occipital network during the execution of the visuomotor task and underline the forward proprieties regarding the online control of the reaching movements.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e3862" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>REINFORCING MALE SEXUAL PHEROMONES ARE NON-VOLATILE CHEMOSIGNALS DETECTED BY

respectively at spinal level. After obtaining institutional ethical approval, intrathecal catheters were implanted into male Wistar rats. A paw withdrawal test was used for nociceptive testing in carrageenan-induced (2 mg) thermal

opportunity to test different hypotheses on the distribution of orientation sensitive neurons over the surface of the cortex.
Rectilinear &#x0201c;slabs&#x0201d; of uniform orientation, as postulated in some earlier models, are not supported by the evidence.
What is compatible with the optical imaging maps is the arrangement of neurons with different orientation around
centers, regularly spaced at distances of about 0.5 mm in a hexagonal array. According to the model proposed by [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>],
the orientations to which the neurons are sensitive should be arranged either radially, or, more likely, like the tangents
[<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] of circles around said centers, whereby in either case twice the same orientation occurs in opposite positions of
the &#x0201c;hypercolumn&#x0201d; thus defined. The centers of the hypercolumns very likely coincide with the so-called cytochrome
oxidase &#x0201c;blobs&#x0201d; which are spaced at the same distance. The fact that within these &#x0201c;blobs&#x0201d; orientation tuning of cortical
neurons becomes undefined [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], makes the array of orientations around these centers less spectacular, and indeed
other interpretations of the coloured maps produced by optical recording were put forward. So-called &#x0201c;pinwheels&#x0201d; stole
the show, that is centers around which neurons with different orientation sensitivity crowd with the colours representing
their orientation clashing without interposed indifferent regions. In these pinwheels each of the different orientations occurs only once as you go full circle around their center. They most likely correspond to the corners between the hypercolumns
in their hexagonal array, and the different orientations within one &#x0201c;pinwheel&#x0201d; most likely belong to three
different hypercolumns that meet there [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>].</p><p>The distinction between the two entities, orientation hypercolumns and pinwheels may sound academic but becomes
crucial when one endeavours to underpin orientation specificity of cortical neurons with schemes of neuronal interactions
at the elementary level. The accompanying illustration should help the reader to partake in this discussion.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B11"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braitenberg</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Peters</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Jones</surname><given-names>EG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Charting the visual cortex</article-title><source><italic>Cerebral Cortex: Volume 3: Visual Cortex</italic></source><year>1985</year><publisher-loc>New York, NY, USA</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Plenum Press</publisher-name><fpage>379</fpage><lpage>414</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B12"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braitenberg</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><person-group person-group-type="editor"><name><surname>Aertsen</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Braitenberg</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>How ideas survive evidence to the contrary: a comment of data display and modelling</article-title><source><italic>Information Processing in the Cortex: Experiments and Theory</italic></source><year>1992</year><publisher-loc>Berlin, Germany</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Springer</publisher-name><fpage>447</fpage><lpage>450</lpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B13"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Braitenberg</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Braitenberg</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Geometry of orientation columns in the visual cortex</article-title><source><italic>Biological Cybernetics</italic></source><year>1979</year><volume>33</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>179</fpage><lpage>186</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">497262</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B14"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Livingstone</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Hubel</surname><given-names>DH</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anatomy and physiology of a color system in the primate visual cortex</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Neuroscience</italic></source><year>1984</year><volume>4</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>309</fpage><lpage>356</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">6198495</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B15"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Obermayer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Blasdel</surname><given-names>GG</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Geometry of orientation and ocular dominance columns in monkey striate cortex</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Neuroscience</italic></source><year>1993</year><volume>13</volume><issue>10</issue><fpage>4114</fpage><lpage>4129</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8410181</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back><floats-group><fig id="fig106-1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Color encoding of a &#x0201c;hypercolumn&#x0201d; (inset 1) and interpretation of an optical imaging picture from [5].

measuring its learning abilities by percent correct localization performance before and after learning, and by the number

both before and after learning. Simulated lesioning of DG decreased post training percent correct localization of
the network, an effect that was found to be reversed by considering more mEC inputs. DG lesions, however, inevitably
decreased the ability of the network to set up independent representations for correlated environments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4302" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PERCEPTION OF OBJECT UNITY IN FISH</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sovrano</surname><given-names>V.

for hippocampal PC firing proposes that PC could be modulated by boundary vector cells (BVC) set to fire at a certain
distance and angle bearing to the arena boundaries behaving in a similar way as subicular PC [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Although some characteristics
of SPCs are known, it is not clear how they code for other extreme changes in size or systematic barrier insertion.
Here we recorded from SPC in multiple arena size: small (50 &#x000d7; 50 cm), medium (100 &#x000d7; 100 cm) and large arenas
(150 &#x000d7; 150 cm). Later, the medium arena open field was transformed in a four equal size communicated subchambers
by inserting 4 barriers. Out of the 129 cells recorded in the size experiment 4 different response patterns were
identified: Perfect scaling units (54%), which firing field location and size were equivalent across conditions. Imperfect
scaling units (4%), similarly located but different relative size. Remapping scaling units (26%) scaled their firing
fields but remapped across conditions. Size sensitive units (16%) presented firing only in some arenas. With respect
to the 65 recorded units in the barrier-multiple chamber room, 92% replicated their firing at least in 2 chambers, 5% displayed plasticity across all 4 rooms and 3% stopped firing in the 4-room arena. Results suggest that SPC can scale up and down their firing fields from small to quite large arenas and that barrier insertion generates similar firing
structure in different similar sub-chambers. The subiculum could be mainly coding for geometry and size of the spatial
context, similarly to the BVC proposed for hippocampal neurons.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENY</title><p>Supported by EU 6th FET PRESENCCIA, N 27731.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="B16"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sharp</surname><given-names>PE</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Subicular place cells expand or contract their spatial firing pattern to fit the size of the environment

inferior temporal (IT) cortical networks, thought to be the long-term memory store for complex visual representations.
An attractor network is endowed with the ability to converge towards pre-established representations, usually the
one most closely correlated with some aspects of the inputs. To determine whether single units in the IT cortex of a behaving
monkey exhibit such convergence, we recorded their responses during a classification task on visual stimuli prepared
by gradually morphing between pairs of familiar images, one of which was chosen to elicit a particularly strong
response (the effective image, while the other was simply less effective). Individual units show a variety of non-linear responses
to successive morphs. On average, however, the initial response reflects the distance along the morphing dimension,
the &#x0201c;physical changes&#x0201d;, while later, after stimulus offset, the responses elicited by the effective image and by its
neighboring morphs were observed to converge as if only the natural category determined the firing level, for effective
morphs. Such evolution of the response could reflect internal network dynamics in IT, perhaps underlying classification
performance, induced either by attractor states or by firing rate adaptation or both. Attractor neural network simulations
seem to discard a potential contribution of firing rate adaptation, and point at the removal of afferent inputs as the
trigger for dynamical network convergence.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDMENT</title><p>Supported by HFSP RGP0047/2004-C, NIH-NCRR, and Whitehall foundation to BJ.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4584" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DO SPATIAL CONSTRAINTS INFLUENCE SEARCH BEHAVIOR IN THE PRESENCE OF CEREBELLAR

the presence of environmental constrains. This aspect was widely investigated in many spatial tasks, such as the radial
maze, in which search behavior is constrained by the intrinsic structure of the apparatus. Conversely, the studies of unconstrained
explorative behavior allow examining how search strategies modify according to environment features. The
present study was aimed to investigate how search behavior could be modified in different spatial configurations in the
presence of cerebellar lesions provoking marked exploration deficits. Namely, many studies demonstrated that cerebellar
networks are specifically involved in the acquisition of the procedural components of different spatial tasks. Hemicerebellectomized
(HCbed) and control rats were tested in a search task in which they had to visit nine food trays spatially
arranged in four independent configurations: a cross, a 3 &#x000d7; 3 matrix, three clusters of three trays each and a circle configuration. The aim of the task was to catch the nine rewards avoiding visits to already depleted trays. When the effects of
the four configurations were taken into account, it appeared that in the cross configuration both groups exhibited the lowest
number of errors as well as a delay in performing the first error. Although no exhaustive searches were observed
in any configuration, in all animals performances improved, as the sessions went by. However, HCbed rats exhibited lower
search performances, displaying a significantly higher number of errors, long pathways to visit the trays, earlier occurrence
of first error, reduced sequence of correct visits. The present data support the role of cerebellum in the acquisition
of novel exploration strategies. Furthermore even in the presence of a cerebellar lesion, structural affordances of the
environment appear to influence the construction of search strategies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4665" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HIPPOCAMPAL ACTIVITY IN RATS DURING TACTILE DISCRIMINATION BEHAVIORS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Itskov</surname><given-names>P.

The present work is aimed at understanding the nature of the representation of the texture-related signals in the hippocampus. We recorded neuronal activity
from the CA1 region of hippocampus while rats used their whiskers to discriminate between a rough and a smooth texture.
We have found the cells in the hippocampus respond selectively to different aspects of the task, for example, touch,
reward delivery. Some cells showed robust discrimination between 2 different textures, for example, their firing rate was
significantly modulated during the contact with the texture or immediately after the contact. We then checked the texture
related activity in a second task where rats had to discriminate between 3 different textures but they had to give the
same response for 2 textures, that is, they had to identify all 3 textures and classify two of them as belonging to the same
category. A small proportion (about 5% of recorded cells) showed different responsemagnitude for 2 textures that were
in the same response class, while most of the cells (about 25% of all recorded cells) showed response levels specific for the
texture class rather than for the individual texture identity. We speculate that a minority of cells in the hippocampus represent
tactile information and while the majority of cells tend to represent the actual meaning of the texture or response
class rather than the exact texture properties.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4688" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HIPPOCAMPAL MOSSY FIBRE DISTRIBUTION CORRELATES WITH MIGRATORY DISTANCE

with the animals reactivity towards external and internal (motivational) stimuli. The hypothesis predicts large
intra- and infrapyramidal mossy fibers for animals in need of stable ongoing behaviour in spite of interfering stimuli,
as we would expect for long distance migratory animals. To test this, we analyzed bats with differences in habitat
shift or true migratory behaviour. For this, the mossy fiber fields were analyzed within and among bat species
using the ratio of intra and infrapyramidal mossy fibres (IIP-MF) to suprapyramidal mossy fibres (SP-MF). Bats (9
wild-living species) have significantly smaller IIP- projections than do mice. In bats, the species with a maximum
migration distance of 1440 km (Vespertilio murinus, particoloured bat) has significantly larger IIP-MF than do all
other bats and shows an IIP/SP ratio within the corresponding range in mice. In bats, Spearman Rank correlation shows
a positive association of the ratio of IIP/SP mossy fibres to habitat shift or migratory distance (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, Rho
0.531). These results are strengthened by the observation that subadult, hence migratory na&#x000ef;ve Vespertilio murinus show
significantly smaller mossy fibers in the hilus and IIP projection field than adults. None of the other species show
MF growth in connection to age and experience. These results, however, have to be re-evaluated, as Vespertilio murinus
is the only long-distance migratory species in this sample. Hence, our prediction of a correlation between MF size
and reactivity measured as migratory behaviour has been confirmed within the order of Chiroptera. Future research
will integrate other mammalian orders and ecological factors such as social system, and will aim to include more
species.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Suppourted by SNF and NCCR &#x0201c;Neural Plasticity and Repair&#x0201d;.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e4732" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE LONG-LASTING EFFECT OF SOCIAL ISOLATION AND SUBCHRONIC KETAMINE

Its receptor is widely expressed in the cerebellum. This implies a role of leptin in regulating cerebellum mediated tasks, including
locomotion and spatial learning. Imbalanced diets are known to alter leptin levels in the periphery. In this study, we examined
two experimental groups of 6-week old male Wistar rats, which followed a different dietary protocol from weaning
to puberty. The high fat (HF) fed group received a diet enriched (45% kcal) in saturated fat and the low fat (LF) fed
group an isocaloric low fat (10%kcal) diet. Animals were tested in the open field and Morris water maze tests. After
sacrifice, we evaluated the expression of leptin receptor in the cerebellum by western blotting. Open field test revealed a
less active spontaneous motor activity of the HF group, since the moving/standing ratio was decreased compared to the LF
group in a statistically significant way. In learning the water maze task, HF group had lower latencies to locate the hidden
escape platform, compared to LF animals. This might imply an enhanced spatial learning and navigation ability for
the HF rats. Swimming velocities did not differ between the groups. Leptin receptors were statistically reduced in the HF
group, possibly reflecting a down regulation shift due to the increased circulating leptin. Our results support an involvement
of leptin signaling in the cerebellum, in behavioral aspects including locomotion and spatial learning. Although a
role of leptin in regulating the aforementioned behaviors has been documented for the limbic system, cerebellum remains
a strong candidate target for the non-metabolic actions of leptin in the CNS.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by a Greek General Secretariat of Research and Technology Program (70/3/8320), co-funded by the European

Because mice and rats are not
especially sensitive to Al, in the present study we investigated the neurobehavioral effects of Al in a transgenic mouse
model of Alzheimer disease. Transgenic 2576 mice and their respective wild controls were fed with rodent chow supplemented
with Al lactate at 0 or 11 g/kg during six months. At one year of age, several tests were carried out. A functional
observational battery showed differences between groups in the arousal and hand reaction. Results in openfield showed
a general effect of Al in the time spent in the center of the open. Moreover, Al exposed mice were more active in the
center of an open field when compared with non exposed mice. The two compartment light/dark test, showed general
effects of animal type on latency to the light compartment and time spent in the dark compartment, tg mice spent more
time in the dark compartment and showed a higher latency to enter the light compartment. Moreover a general effect of
Al was observed in time spent in the dark and in the number of entries to the light compartment. Al exposure tens to
increase activity in both transgenic and wild mice, this increase is higher in transgenic mice. Results in water maze test
showed a general effect of animal type in acquisition, and an interaction between Al treatment and animal type. Differences
between groups were observed during the whole acquisition period. In general terms aluminum treatment improve
acquisition in wild mice and impair acquisition in transgenic treated mice. However, retention was neither affected by animal
type nor by aluminum exposure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5083" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ADULT HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS IN ST8SIAIV/P- ST-KNOCKOUT MICE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zerwas</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l57">

Although the steps from the
generation of new cells to their integration into the existing network are gradually being unveiled on the cellular level,
their functional role is still controversially being discussed. However, evidence is emerging that adult newborn cells play a role in some types of learning and memory processes, a prominent example being hippocampally-dependent spatial
memory. The carbohydrate polysialic acid (PSA), uniquely associated with the neural cell adhesion molecule NCAM, is
predominantly found in the developing brain. Nevertheless, its expression persists in brain regions of plasticity, such as
the hippocampus, during adulthood. Here, young newborn neurons display PSA-NCAM. Furthermore, levels of PSANCAM
are transiently increased following hippocampally-dependent learning. This strongly suggests the implication
of PSA in both adult neurogenesis and cognitive processes. Moreover, knockout (ko) mice lacking the enzyme polysialyl
transferase ST8SiaIV/PST and hence practically devoid of PSA in adulthood, have recently been shown to be impaired
in the morris water maze for reversal learning, a test for hippocampally-dependent spatial memory. We examined
the hippocampal neurogenic potential in 6 monthold male ST8SiaIV/PST-ko mice. At this age the amount of
PSA-NCAM is reduced by 75% in mutant mice compared to controls. Cell proliferation in the hippocampus was investigated using the cell cycle marker Ki67. With doublecortin, a marker of immature neurons, the window of the impact of
PSA lack was further confined. Using BrdU, we determined the survival rate of 30 day-old newborn cells. Stereological
analysis of these immunostainings allowed us to detect differences in hippocampal neurogenesis in ST8SiaIV/PST-ko
mice compared to their wild type littermates.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by EU 6th FP PROMEMORIA, LSHM-CT-2005- 512012.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5161" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ARE NEW HIPPOCAMPAL NEURONS INVOLVED IN THE RETRIEVAL OF LONG-TERM MEMORY IN

might subserve cognitive functions. Studies have shown that spatial learning, which heavily relies on the hippocampus,
can enhance the survival of newborn neurons. Conversely, reduction of neurogenesis by irradiation impairs long-term
memory retrieval but not acquisition. However, the question remains as to whether new neurons born before learning
may be recruited into dentate gyrus circuits by participating in long-term spatial memory retrieval. Adult C57BL/6J mice
were injected over 1 day with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU, 3 &#x000d7; 100 mg/kg, ip) and were trained one week later in the
Morris water maze (MWM). Training consisted in 24 trials over 1 day (fixed platform location, various starting points).
BrdU-labelled cells were 9 days-old at the time of training, an age when these cells exhibit functional plasticity. A single
probe test was given 30 days after training. To isolate nonspecific aspects of the procedure, control groups included
&#x0201c;swimmers&#x0201d;, yoked-control mice, &#x0201c;cue-learners&#x0201d; trained in a hippocampus-independent version of the task and &#x0201c;homecage
controls&#x0201d;. Mice were sacrificed 2 hours after the probe test and immunohistochemistry of the activity-dependent
gene zif268 was used to quantify neurons processing spatial memory during retention testing. Phenotype of the surviving
BrdU cells was established using NeuN, a marker of mature neurons. Our results show that survival of newborn neurons
is increased by spatial learning compared to swimmers. A significant proportion of new neurons expressed Zif268 following
long-term spatial or cue memory retrieval. Our data suggest an early functional recruitment of newborn neurons into
neuronal networks involved in long-term spatial memory retrieval.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by ANR-06-Neuro-27-03.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5240" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>BEHAVIORAL EFFECTS OF ADULT MICE EXPOSED TO PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE (PFOS)</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fuentes</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l61">

Recent findings of its global distribution, environmental persistence, presence in humans and wildlife and adverse health effects
in laboratory animal studies have generated considerable interest in this compound. Although numerous human and
wildlife biomonitoring studies have been conducted, not much is known about its behavioral effects. Therefore, in the
present work we assessed the effects of PFOS on behavior after one month of exposure. Thirty adult mice were divided
in three groups (<italic>n</italic> = 10). Animals were dosed by gavage 0, 3 or 6 mg PFOS/kg/day for four weeks. After the treatment period, mice were evaluated for several skills by testing motor and sensory function with a functional observation battery
(FOB), general activity and exploratory behavior in an openfield and learning and memory in a water maze task. One
week after behavioral testing, all animals were deeply anesthetized and blood from cava vein collected and centrifuged
in order to obtain serum for corticosterone analysis by RIA. No general effects were observed in the FOB. Activity in the
open-field was similar in all the groups, the only observed differences were: group PFOS 3 spent less time in the center
and group PFOS 6 performed a reduced rate of vertical activity. Concerning the effects of PFOS in the water maze, all
animals learned the task, but no effect of group was observed during the acquisition. In the retention test, Control group presented a reduced swim velocity within the target quadrant, which may indicate that they did recognize the target
location. These results suggest that PFOS exposure induce behavioral effects in adult male mice.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5307" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SPATIAL LEARNING DURING THE NEONATAL PERIOD USING THE MOTHER AS A POSITIVE OR

When
mother contact is used as either a positive or a negative reinforcer, rat pups, both those denied contact (frustrated) and those
allowed contact as continuous reward (non-frustrated), can learn a T-maze after a four day training (postnatal day 10&#x02013;13). Although, both experimental groups acquire the spatial memory task, it appears that non-frustrated rats follow
procedural learning processes. Frustrated pups, on the other hand, which show an increased activation of the hippocampus,
employ a cognitive strategy that still remains elusive. In an effort to address this issue, we subjected them to two different
memory probe trials where the mother was either absent, or placed in the reverse position to that during training.
In the absence of the mother animals spent most time in the start position of the T-maze, while in the reverse probe trial
they stayed the longest in the armof the maze that led to their mother. However detailed analysis of the path followed by
the pups revealed that most of them initially turned towards the arm where their mother was during the training sessions
(&#x0201c;target arm&#x0201d;), indicating that they had acquired the spatial information. Furthermore, a positive correlation was found
between performance during learning and time spent in the &#x0201c;target arm&#x0201d;. The above results show that, in spite of the frustrative
non-reward training, animals learn the T-maze, but, at the same time, the presence of the mother provides the
motivation essential for the execution of the motor program of approach by the pups.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work has been supported by the Special Account for Research

the hippocampal formation, via the fornix, and projecting in turn to the anterior thalamic nuclei, by way of the mammillothalamic
tract (MTT). Lesions of the MTT produce persistent deficits on spatial memory tasks comparable with those
seen after MB lesions. While memory impairments found after MTT lesions are assumed to be due to the disruption of
the MB projections to the anterior thalamus, it is not known whether disconnecting these structures may have wider effects
on more distal brain regions. In the present study, the quantification of immediate-early gene (IEG) expression was
used as a marker of neuronal activity in animals that had received either bilateral lesions of the MTT or sham surgery.
Rats were trained on a forced-choice version of the radialarm maze task but on the final test day rats performed the
task in a novel room in order to increase demands on spatial encoding. MTT lesions markedly reduced IEG expression in
the retrosplenial cortex, another component of the Delay and Brion circuit, and a structure also implicated in spatial memory.
The present results are consistent with previous studies as reduced retrosplenial IEG expression has also been reported
following lesions of both the hippocampus and anterior thalamic nuclei. However, while the hippocampus and
anterior thalamus both have dense, direct connections with the retrosplenial cortex, the MTT lesion effects are indirect
and are, therefore, even more striking. Together, these results highlight both the importance of the integrity of the Delay
and Brion circuit for normal retrosplenial activity and the need to interpret MTT lesion effects not solely in terms of
the mammillary body-anterior thalamic disconnection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5371" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ENCODING OF THE TOPOLOGY OF SPACE BY HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Alvernhe</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Van Cauter</surname><given-names>T.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Save</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Poucet</surname><given-names>B.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Laboratoire de Neurobiologie de la Cognition, Universit&#x000e9; de Provence/CNRS, Marseille, France</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Hippocampal place cells are pyramidal cells that display location-specific activity, that is, fire when the animal is in a
specific location in the environment (called the place field of the cell). A remarkable property of place cells is their sensitivity
to environmental modifications. For example, changing the shape or color of the apparatus induces a reorganization
of place fields, a phenomenon called remapping.Here, we examine how CA1 place cells respond to a topological change
in the environment. Place cell activity was recorded while rats alternated between two food-rewarded goals in an Mmaze.
Following an initial recording session, the topology of the maze was modified by removing an inner wall, therefore generating
a shortcut. The results show that place cells that had fields close to the removed wall remapped (i.e., changed their
location, shape, or firing rate) whereas most place cells that had fields at a distance from the removed wall remained stable.
These results are compatible with the notions of local (restricted to the changed region) and partial (only a part of
the place cell population is affected) remapping. Such remappings can be interpreted in the light of the attractor network
theory of hippocampal function, in which the connexions between attractor networks generated during learning reflect
the time sequence of visited regions, and therefore the topology of space.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5406" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FROM PILOTING TO MAP NAVIGATION- A PROPOSED EXPERIMENTAL MODEL OF SPATIAL REPRESENTATION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Avni</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eilam</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Dept.

segments; 2) Orienting (Parallel processing): space is represented in relation to a fixed place that is a terminal for repeated
sequential processing that varies, yet starts and ends at that location, thus heading direction ultimately points to the
fixed location; 3) Navigating (Continuous processing): space representation (&#x0201c;map&#x0201d;) is constructed by orienting (continuously updating heading direction) in relation to several places (landmarks). Each phase is based on spatial information gained in previous phases, thus reflecting a progress to a higher level of information processing. Empirically, we so
far demonstrated a transition from sequential to parallel processing in the exploratory behavior of gerbils. When tested
in an unfamiliar dark environment, gerbils first explored the open field using a looping mechanism: traveling slowly in
an undulating path that forms a loop by returning to a previously visited place. In looping, the gerbils rarely returned
more than once to a previously visited place, with no apparently fixed heading direction, as if behavior is not anchored
to the environment. Rather, they seem to shift from one location (landmark) to the next. Gradually, the gerbils shifted
from looping to a home base mechanism, spending increasingly greater time in one place and repeatedly returning to
it. Exploration became organized in relation to a fixed place, with varying paths that share a heading direction computed
in relation to the same place (the home base). We suggest this as a shift from piloting (looping) to orienting (home base behavior),
reflecting a change from momentary to fixed heading direction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5429" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE ROLE OF GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR SUBTYPES WITHIN THE PREFRONTAL AND PERIRHINAL CORTICES

of glutamatergic and cholinergic receptor neurotransmission in these cortical regions for performance of an
object-in-place discrimination task. Selective AMPA/kainite, NMDA or muscarinic receptor antagonists were infused into
the PRH or mPFC via chronically implanted via bilateral guide cannulae prior to acquisition in an object-in-place

Infusions of scopolamine (a muscarinic receptor antagonist) into the mPFC, PRH or both regions in contralateral

perceptual processing remains unclear. In the present study we examined the specific involvement of m1 cholinergic receptors
in PRh in spontaneous object recognition memory, as well as a perceptual task&#x02014;simultaneous oddity discrimination.
In the first experiment, rats received counterbalanced intra-PRh infusions of either saline or the m1 receptor
antagonist pirenzepine 15 minutes before a given object recognition trial. The retention delay between sample and
choice phases was either 0-s or 3 hr. Pre-sample infusions of pirenzepine significantly impaired object recognition memory
with a 3-hr retention delay compared to the same rats on saline trials. Pirenzepine did not, however, cause an impairment
when a 0-s retention delay was utilized. In the second experiment, we examined whether pirenzepine would affect
performance in an oddity discrimination task in which all objects were presented simultaneously; the perceptual similarity
of the stimuli varied according to three different conditions (easy, medium, and hard). A new group of rats received pre-trial intra-PRh infusions of pirenzepine or saline. Pirenzepine significantly impaired oddity discrimination performance
compared to saline in the hard condition, but not in the easy and medium conditions. This result suggests that
difficult perceptual tasks require m1 receptors in PRh. Collectively, these findings suggest an important role for m1 receptors
in PRh for memory acquisition and for the perceptual processing of complex stimuli. The delay- and perceptual
difficulty-dependant nature of the pirenzepine-induced deficits suggests thatm1 receptor-mediated information processing
in PRh is critical for demanding mnemonic and perceptual functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5487" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TRANSITIONS IN BEHAVIORALLY CORRELATED ACTIVITY IN MEDIAL PREFRONTAL NEURONS OF

Previously, this approach showed a role of hippocampal neurogenesis in learning and memory, particularly with the Morris water-maze and fearconditioning. However, such behavioral impairment may arise from combined effects of neurogenesis and other radiation-induced brain changes. To address this question, we investigated the effects of a cranially focused low dose of radiation on behavioral performance. We used Cyclin D2 knockout mice, which lack adult hippocampal neurogenesis. Mice were exposed to 10 Gy of Xrays, a dose known to induce hippocampal-dependent cognitive
and learning deficits. Classical behavioral tests were the Morris water-maze, open-field, and fear conditioning. We
also monitored the behavior of the mice in the IntelliCage (NewBehavior, AG), an automated home cagelike device. Results
were:

</p><p>Exposure to radiation significantly reduced long-term memory retention in WT-mice to levels similar to those of KO-mice.
The later effect argues against claims that radiation effects are not specific to adult neurogenesis. These results
show a similarity between cognitive changes induced by genetically and radiation-induced ablation of adult neurogenesis,
suggesting a phenomenological specificity of the effects of radiation on hippocampal neurogenesis and performance
in hippocampus-dependent behaviors.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by NCCR &#x0201c;Neural Plasticity and Repair&#x0201d;, SNF and FP6. 037965.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5760" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>C-FOS EXPRESSION IN MAMMILLARY BODIES AFTER LEARNING IN A SPATIAL WORKING

There are some evidences that
showing a great implication of this region in allocentric spatial processing by rats. Although the involvement of the
mammillary bodies in memory processes has been shown, the relevance of these nuclei has remained poorly understood.
In the present study, rats were trained on a spatial working memory task that could be solved by place strategy.
Male and female rats performed a spatial orientation tasks in the holeboard, which permits assessment of working memory.
The holeboard apparatus consists of an open-field with a 16-hole floor insert. Across trials, animals have to learn that
4 holes of 16 are baited. Configuration of baited holes was changed trial to trial. The aim of this study was to assess the
effect of spatial training with working memory demands to solve the task, related to c-fos expression in the mammillary
bodies. Rats readily acquired this task within 4 days at two trials per day (sample-retention), but no differences between
sexes were found. One hour after training, the number of c-Fos positive neuronal nuclei was quantified in the mammillary
body region (medial mammillary nucleus [MMn], lateral mammillary nucleus [LMn] and supramammillary nucleus
[SuM]). The results shown that c-Fos immunoreactivity (IR) was significantly higher in the SuM of males and females,
and in the MMn of males trained than in control rats. On the other hand, no sex differences were shown between
males and females trained rats in c-Fos-IR. In conclusion, our results suggest that the regions studied by immunohistochemical
analysis of the c-Fos protein play a different role in spatial working memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5836" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A NEURAL NETWORK MODEL FOR GRID CELLS: COHERENCE IN THE POPULATION DYNAMICS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cerasti</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Treves</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>SISSA, Triesta, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>An important feature of grid cells in mEC is that they present firing fields that remain coherent among themselves across changes in the environment, even if the individual firing fields change (Fyhn et al. 2007).

A mouse mutant deficient in
Gdi1 was generated. The phenotype of the Gdi1 KO mice may be ascribed to alterations in a subset of Rab GTPases
that were found concentrated on intracellular vesicle membranes, possibly in their GDP bound inactive form, and a
reduced concentration in their soluble form. Electrophysiological analysis of the KO mice revealing that slow repetitive
stimulation induced short-lasting impairments of synaptic transmission: a post-tetanic depression was observed in mutant
mice suggesting depletion of the available SV pool. EM analysis was performed on P10, P23, and P90 hippocampus
of Gdi1 KO mouse mice, to monitor SV density. SV counting revealed a significant reduction of the SV density in mutant
mice in all stages analyzed. A detailed study of their learning and behaviour capacity showed a specific cognitive impairments
detected in two tests: the 8-arms radial maze and the trace fear conditioning, both dependent on a functionally
intact hippocampus and on the ability to form short-term memory. We showed that in the trace fear conditioning test,
the Gdi1 KO mice were impaired in forming the association between CS and US if they were separated by a short time interval.
When the ITI between each CS-US pairing was more than 30 minutes KO mice associate the two stimuli as well as
the WT mice. In the 8-arms radial maze test, Gdi1 KO mice showed specific impairment in working memory formation,
but they exhibit intact working memory when the arms were reduced to 4 or 6, and also when we pretrained them on 4-
arms and then tested on 8-arms. It is likely that while mass training eventually caused depletion of the SV pool, during
a longer ITI the KO mice can restore the SV pool required for efficient synaptic transmission and shortterm memory
formation and processing. All these data suggest that lack of Gdi1 in the brain of KO mice alters steps controlling formation
and maintenance of the pool of SV through intracellular trafficking possibly through Rab activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e5929" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LATERALIZATION OF SOCIAL LEARNING IN THE DOMESTIC CHICK (<italic>GALLUS GALLUS</italic>): LEARNING TO AVOID</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Daisley</surname><given-names>J.

One question that arises is, what
is the extent to which path integration and familiar visual cues cooperate to optimize navigational performance. The
discovery of grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex (Hafting et al., Nature, 2005) has opened a new field of research.
Grid cells fire when the rat is running in a box, and is in any one of a number of locations that are arranged in a regular
hexagonal grid.The grid cells are likely to be key components of a brain mechanism that constantly updates the rat's sense
of its location, even in the absence of external sensory input. We recorded spike activity in grid cells in the entorhinal cortex
and in the hippocampus while rats run for food in a large open field and in a hairpin-maze of the same dimensions.
The hairpin maze was used to force the rat to cover the whole twodimensional box while performing a one-dimensional
task. As expected, triangular grid fields emerged in the open field. In the hairpin maze, the grid structure broke up into
repeating patterns dictated by the hairpin turns. Firing fields emerged at similar distances between the start and end of
each linear segment of the maze. The results suggest that the boundary conditions of the grid may be set by the walls
which restrict the path of the rat; thus, similar paths in different positions may evoke replicating grid-field representations.
The observations imply that the grid-cell representation in the one-dimensional case is not simply a projection
of a two-dimensional representation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6109" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECTS OF METRIC TRANSFORMATIONS OF AN ARRAY OF LOCAL LANDMARKS ON

Using this method, it has been shown that chicks can retrieve the goal location by relying on the global geometry of the enclosure as well as on local landmarks. However, little is known on how chicks encode the spatial relationship
between a goal and the local orienting cues. To investigate this issue, we performed two experiments. In the
first experiment, chicks were trained to locate food in the centre of a square-shaped arena in the presence of two landmarks
which were spaced 25 cm apart along one of the walls of the enclosure. After training, chicks were tested binocularly
(BIN) and in monocular conditions (RE: right-eye; LE: left-eye) after enlarging or contracting the distance separating
the landmarks. At test, BIN and LE still searched for food at the centre of the arena, irrespective of the array
transformation. RE chicks relied more on local cues, moving toward the axis of the configuration when metric
transformations occurred. In the second experiment, chicks were trained to locate food with respect to the landmarks
only (i.e., food was located in different positions within the enclosure but in a fixed spatial relationship with respect
to landmarks). LE-chicks were more scattered in searching behaviour when compared to the other two groups. BIN-and
RE-chicks approached the array along its axis when contracted, whereas they approached closely the points defined
by vector of orientation taken out by single landmark when the array was expanded. These data suggests
that chicks, under certain circumstances, may be able to encode the geometrical properties of a landmark configuration.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6175" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ANTERIOR BUT NOT LATERAL THALAMIC NUCLEI LESIONS IMPAIR ALLOCENTRIC SPATIAL MEMORY</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wolff</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l78">

compared three memory tasks in rats with selective neurotoxic lesions either to the AT or the lateral medial thalamic

LT rats on this last task contrasted with previous findings reporting a detrimental effect of LT lesions in a working memory

associative memory task showing characteristics of relational memory, the social transmission of food preference.
Nevertheless, the role of muscarinic receptors of particular prefrontal areas, such as the prelimbic cortex, in consolidation
processes has not been completely specified. Experiment 1 determined whether the blockade of muscarinic
cholinergic receptors in prelimbic cortex affects consolidation of the socially transmitted food preferences. Experiment
2 examined the effects of the same treatment on consolidation of a tone-shock associative implicit learning paradigm, the two-way active avoidance task. In both experiments, bilateral infusions of scopolamine hydrobromide (20&#x00026;956 g/side) were administered immediately after training, and a reten tion test was carried out 24 hours later. The results showed that the blockade of muscarinic receptors significantly impaired retention of the relational memory task shown by the lower preference for an odor-cued food that had been learned 24 hours previously, but not the implicit task, where both groups show a similar number of correct avoidance responses. Such data suggest that muscarinic transmission in the prelimbic cortex is important for early
memory formation of a relational socially-transmitted food preference task, but not of an implicit instrumental avoidance

the effects of PF lesions in the acquisition, extinction and the reversal learning of an implicit odor-reward association task
(ODT). Pretraining bilateral N-methyl-D-aspartate (0.15 M) lesions were made one week before ODT acquisition (1 session,
5 trials). A single extinction session or a reversal session (5 trials) was conducted 24 hours after ODT acquisition.
Latency for the correct responses and number of errors were recorded to obtain a performance score. Present data
suggest a differential effect of PF lesions depending on the specific cognitive functions assessed. Considering anatomical
and functional data, we suggest that the PF influence might be exerted by setting or maintaining the activation of prefrontal
circuitry needed for displaying behavioral flexibility.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6316" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECTS OF VOLUNTARY PHYSICAL EXERCISE ON ANXIETY, EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOR AND

Most studies show a decrease in anxiety related behaviors, but some find an increase. Regarding learning and memory, a facilitation of hippocampaldependent
tasks is the most common result. This effect has been related with an increase on the expression of neurotrophic factors
(BDNF) in hippocampus. A poorly understood aspect in these effects is the &#x0201c;dose&#x0201d;. It has been approached using treadmills
at different speeds or durations. However, this forced exercise generally involves stressing procedures that can mask
the effect of exercise. In the present experiment, we studied the effect of four weeks of voluntary exercise on a running
wheel, upon behavior on an elevated plusmaze, an open field, and upon two different learning tasks: an object recognition
task, that relies on perirhinal cortex and hippocampus, and a two-way active avoidance task, that relies mainly on the
striatum where exercise do not increase BDNF expression. Subjects were young Wistar rats maintained by pairs in the
homecage. Data were analyzed considering either the subjects as a whole or divided in three different groups: low runners
(LR), high runners (HR) and very high runners (VR). We found that exercise increased most anxiety-like behaviors,
especially in LR. Exploration behaviors were decreased by exercise, especially in VR. Regarding learning and memory,
exercise modulated the object recognition task, but had no effect on the two-way active avoidance task.Unexpectedly,
exercise modulated object recognition in a U-inverted manner, that is, LR were facilitated, whereas HR and VR were impaired.
We conclude that exercise increase defensive behaviors, decrease the motivation to explore and modulate learning
and memory depending on the neural circuit involved in the task. The intensity of exercise seems to be a crucial variable
in these effects.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Support: MEC (BSO2003-04113) and predoctoral grant to S.

effect has been observed mainly in tasks with emotionally
arousing information, such as aversive and some appetitive
tasks. The present experiment investigated whether posttraining
epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg) can also improve memory
consolidation for emotionally neutral tasks. Specifically, we
studied the effect of post-training epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg)
on memory 24 or 48 hr after the acquisition session of a standard
object recognition task (Ennaceur and Delacour, 1988),
a spontaneous task that does not require food or water deprivation,

the same effect can be observed when dissecting two components
of this task: the &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; component (24 h memory
for the object itself) and the &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; component (24 h memory
for the place where the object was located in the acquisition
session). The results showed that all the groups recognized
the object previously explored in the standard version
of the task (both at 24 and at 48-hours retention), and
they also recognized the familiar object and the location of it in the &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; component versions, respectively.
This suggests that present task can be considered an implicit
form of episodic memory. We also found that epinephrine
enhanced standard object recognition memory either on
the 24 and 48-hr retention tests. Moreover, epinephrine
also improved memory for the &#x0201c;what&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;where&#x0201d; components
of this episodic-like memory. Our results indicate that
epinephrine can modulate memory for emotionally neutral

posttraining intracranial self-stimulation is also able to facilitate a spatial learning and memory task in the Morris water

sessions, one daily, consisting of two-minute duration trials. Starting from a variable position, rats had to swim
in a 2 m-diameter pool until meeting a hide platform signalled by a cue located over the wall of its opposite site. Each
daily session was followed by an immediate treatment of intracranial self-stimulation. Control subjects did not receive
the self-stimulation treatment. In the four successive experiments rats were given eight, five, three and one trial per session,
respectively. Temporal latencies and trajectories to meet the platform were measured for each subject. A strong and
consistent facilitation of performance was observed from the second session onward when the rats were given only one
daily trial. We did not observed differences between experimental and control groups in the other three experiments

inhibitory and active avoidance, T-maze delayed alternation or Morris water maze). ICSS is a harmless and
easily administrable technique that, besides being capable of facilitating learning and memory, could compensate some
cognitive deficit caused by aging or by brain damage. Some of the facilitative ICSS effects have been attributed to structural
changes (increase in dendritic intersection and length, spine density or in the number of excrescences) on brain
areas related to learning and memory. Nevertheless, little is known about its molecular and functional mechanisms. In
the ICSS procedure, the experimental subjects are taught to self-stimulate by pressing a lever with electrical current (at
intensities ranging from 10 to 250 microA) by chronically implanted electrodes in MFB. By using high-density oligonucleotide
arrays, we profiled gene expression in memory and learning-related brain regions of rats after ICSS treatment
(2500 trains of ICSS at the optimal intensity of each rat) compared to control rats (with electrode implanted but without
stimulation). Our analysis show more than 250 transcripts differentially expressed in the hippocampus. We want to report
a small group of genes related to the increase of activity, ex. Kfl 15 a glucose transporter transcription factor,
glycerol-3-phosphate 1, sarcomeric mitochondrial creatine kinase (Ckmt2) and Per 2. And we want to stand out an extended
group of genes involved in signal transduction, most of them reported previously to be related with neural plasticity,
LTP or learning; among the upregulated: c-Fos, PACAP, cart and Plcl1 and Pde1a in the downregulated ones. Our
results provide a set of candidate genes to be related to the learning-enhancement properties of ICSS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6539" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A BALANCED MEMORY NETWORK</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roudi</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Peter</surname><given-names>L.

Two salient experimental features of persistent activity are low firing rates and high variability.
Existing models, however, do not elucidate how these are achieved. Here we propose a model that does. Based
on this model, we find that only two condition are needed to ensure low, irregular firing: during learning, changes in
the synaptic weights should be much smaller than the background weights, and the fraction of neurons selective for a
memory should be above some threshold. When these are satisfied, parameters that support low, irregular firing can be
found with very little fine tuning of network parameters. We also find that the number of memories that can be stored in
such a network is proportional to the number of connections per neuron.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6562" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MALE AND FEMALE C-FOS EXPRESSION IN SPATIAL WORKING MEMORY</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>M&#x000e9;ndez-L&#x000f3;pez</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>M&#x000e9;ndez</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>L&#x000f3;pez</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Arias</surname><given-names>J.

These differences had been related to the gonadal steroids action on brain regions including components of Papezs circuit. According to this,
neuronal expression of c-Fos is useful to investigate brain substrates related to spatial memory in males and females.
The aim of this work was to assess the c- Fos immunoreactivity of anterior thalamic nuclei, dorsal hippocampus and
medial and lateral mammillary bodies after training wistar rats (30 days) of both sexes in the Morris Water Maze. Two
control groups of each sex were used to rule out the effect of swimming and handling on the c-Fos immunoreactivity
measures. The training protocol consisted in a matching to sample procedure with one session per day of two equal trials,
probe and retention, that changed throughout days. The behavioural results showed that both males and females were
able to adquire the task with differences in speed adquisition. Males spent 4 sessions to reach the established criterion,
forty session retention latency was significantly smaller than the probe (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.033) and than first session retention (<italic>P</italic> = 0.005). However, females needed 8 sessions to reach significant reduction on retention latency related to probe trial (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) and retention in session 1 (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002). Task related increase in c-Fos immunoreactivity was different between sexes in anterior thalamic nuclei and dorsal hippocampus. In males, significant increased was found in dorsal, ventral and medial anterior thalamic nuclei, but only anteroventral increase was described in females. Females hippocampal changes in c-Fos occurred in CA3 region and dentate gyrus but only CA3 was involved in males. Contrast to this, the medial and lateral mammillary bodies showed significant increase in both sexes. The results suggest that this
spatial learning is differentially processed in male and female brain.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by grant SEJ2004-07445 MEC Spain.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6615" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>WHAT IS THE ROLE FOR THE PRELIMBIC-INFRALIMBIC AREA IN RULE SHIFTING: INVOLVEMENT IN UPDATING?</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Oualian</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gisquet-Verrier</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>CNRS UMR 8620, Universit&#x000e9; Paris Sud, 91400 Orsay, France</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A great deal of evidence indicates that the prelimbicinfralimbic (PL/IL) area of the rodent medial prefrontal cortex
is implicated in behavioural flexibility, demonstrated by experiments investigating the effects of PL/IL dysfunction on
rule shifting. However, PL/IL involvement largely depends on the type of rule shift, and the kind of PL/IL dysfunction.
Here, the contribution of PL/IL was investigated following lesions and after specific injections of a dopamine D1 receptor
antagonist, in a shift from a visual to a response strategy. Rats were trained first to enter the lighted arm of a Ymaze
in order to get a food pellet and one day later to give always the same body turn, independently of the light location.
In every case, rats were trained until a criterion of 10 consecutive correct responses. Ibotenic acid PL/IL lesions
had no effect on performance or the ability to adapt to the new rule. These results contrast with those obtained when
PL/IL dysfunction was induced by D1 antagonist. Rats with cannula in PL/IL were trained as in the previous experiment
and received SCH 23390 PL/IL injections (1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L; 1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g) just before the rule shift. Unexpectedly, this treatment facilitated the shift from the visual to the response strategy. Analysis of
the strategies used to solve the task revealed that this facilitative effect resulted from an inability for the subjects placed
in the same environment to use previous information when required to learn a new rule. This result which suggests that
PL/IL is involved in the capacity to update initially acquired memory, could also account for other performance disruption
resulting from PL/IL dysfunction (extinction, drug reinstatement). Experiments accounting for the differential effects
of the lesions versus the dopaminergic blockade are under investigation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6644" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FUNCTIONAL MAPPING USING FOS IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY OF THE NEONATAL

that both frustrated (pups denied contact with the mother) and non-frustrated (rewarded by unrestricted contact) rats
showed improved performance over training during postnatal days 10&#x02013;13. The aim of the present study was to assess the
brain areas involved in learning under frustrative conditions versus reward, using Fos immunoreactivity for functional mapping. Increased number of Fos immunopositive cells were found in every area studied for both frustrated and nonfrustrated
rats compared to controls (naive animals). Frustration resulted in increased number of Fos immunopositive
cells in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, while in the striatum the number of Fos immunopositive cells was
higher in the pups receiving continuous reward. These results indicate that non-frustrated rats receiving continuous reward
develop a procedural-type learning process, as revealed by activation of the basal ganglia. On the other hand, frustrative
non-reward leads to a behavioural state of increased vigilance and appraisal of environmental stimuli with concomitant
activation of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. It is known that the prefrontal cortex is responsible for
decoding the reward (and punishment) value of primary reinforcers and for what is called stimulusreinforcement association
learning; Moreover, it represents the components responsible for triggering the error-detection neurons that
respond during frustrative non-reward. The hippocampus, which is also more activated in the frustrated than the nonfrustrated
animals, plays a role in information processing decoding contextual changes and conflict between inherent
drives and environmental stimuli.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work has been supported by the Special Account for Research Grants-University of Athens.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6691" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DISSOCIATION OF ENTORHINAL AND PREFRONTAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO TRACE FEAR CONDITIONING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Esclassan</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l93">

bridged to allow an association between these two stimuli. We previously showed that this process does not critically

throughout the trace interval. Cortical structures such as the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and entorhinal cortex
(EC) are likely substrates for persistent representations. Na&#x000ef;ve Long-Evans rats with excitotoxic lesions to either the
mPFC (prelimbic and infralimbic cortices) or the EC were submitted to a trace (30 s) or zero-trace (0 s) conditioning
protocol with five pairings of a tone CS (4000 Hz, 10 s, 70 dB) and footshock (0.4 mA, 1 s).The tone responsewasmeasured
in a distinctive context 48 h after conditioning. Rats submitted to EC lesions showed a selective attenuation of freezing
to a trace-conditioned tone, whereas rats with neurotoxic lesions of the mPFC showed deficits in zero-trace conditioning
and a non significant reduction in trace-conditioned responses. This indicates that trace conditioning involves a specific
contribution of the EC but not the mPFC. The critical role of the EC in trace conditioning could involve persistent
activities requiring cholinergic activation. This hypothesis was tested through microinjections into the EC of cholinergic
agents prior to conditioning. Microinjections of the M1 muscarinic antagonist pirenzepine strongly attenuated traceconditioned
responses while leaving delay responses unaffected. We conclude that the mPFC is not specifically involved
in trace conditioning whereas the EC plays a major role through cholinergic-dependent activities.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6753" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>FLEXIBLE BEHAVIOUR IN A TASK OF EPISODIC-LIKE RECALL IN THE RAT</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fitchett</surname><given-names>A.

Using the Morris water maze, most studies have
shown a navigation deficit at the age of 25&#x02013;27 months in rodents eventually revealing a subtle deficit around 15 months.
Our aim was to detect much earlier spatial memory deficit and to characterize them. Navigation toward an invisible goal
involves two complementary processes: the acquisition of a spatial knowledge and the use of this spatial knowledge in
order to elaborate the most direct path toward the goal. We hypothesized that early detection might be possible studying
these navigation processes specifically.</p><p>Therefore, we compared 3, 10, 17 and 20-month-old mice in an aquatic maze with alleys, developed in our team:
the &#x0201c;starmaze&#x0201d;. This maze allows precise characterization of the different navigation processes mentioned above. The aim
of the task is to reach a hidden platform located in a fixed alley. We characterized the mices ability to localize the platform
and to develop a direct path toward the goal. We also checked anxiety, activity, motor and visual mices ability.</p><p>The results revealed that from the age of 10 months, two subgroups can be detected: one group presented abilities
comparable to 3-month-old mice and the other falling outside the range of the youngs performance. 10-month-old bad
learners were all impaired in the ability to elaborate a direct path and 67 percent of them were also impaired in their
ability to localize the goal. The proportion of bad learners rose with mices age; we respectively observed 17, 47 and 55
percents of bad learners at the age of 10, 17 and 20 months. These deficits were not correlated with anxiety, poor motor

Kurodas theoretical proposal, we have tried to obtain Cantorlike patterns of activity in experiments with CA1 pyramidal
neurons. Temporally associated and non-associated electrical stimulation trains were delivered to Schaffer collaterals, and
membrane potentials were recorded using the patch-clamp recording method. We found that at least two trains of advance
electrical stimulation affect the ensuing neuronal responses. The time course of the response patterns depends
on whether the sequential electrical stimulation is sufficient to induce action potentials. Our results suggest that the potentials
of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal CA1 show Cantor-like coding of successive spatiotemporal information.
This process appears to have at least two modes, depending on the membrane potential.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e6953" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CANTOR CODING OF TEMPORAL SEQUENCES IN HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 MODEL NEURONS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yamaguti</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l100">

in order to investigate how the CA1 network encodes the
spatio-temporal input sequences from CA3. Since CA1 pyramidal
cells have less recurrent connections compared with
CA3 cells, it may be thought that CA1 has different functional
roles from CA3. One hypothesis is that CA1 would be
involved in the information processing of temporal input sequences.
The hypothesis of &#x0201c;Cantor coding&#x0201d; in CA1 has been
proposed by Tsuda and Kuroda (2001, 2003). Cantor coding
provides the scheme for encoding temporal sequences of
events. It forms a fractallike hierarchical structure in the state
space of neural dynamics. Here, in order for investigating the
Cantor coding hypothesis, we constructed a model for CA1
which consists of conductance-based model neurons. In the
model, it was assumed that the CA3 outputs temporal sequences
of spatial patterns, each of which represents a single
episodic event. The pyramidal cells in CA1 are assumed to
receive such activity. The response of the CA1 cells to each
input forms a state vector, which is viewed as an information
representation of CA1. It is revealed that the states of
CA1 were hierarchically clustered in a self-similar manner
according to the similarity of input sequences. Furthermore,
linear discrimination analysis showed that distinct input sequences
of up to about five length were well encoded in the
CA1 state space without overlaps. These results suggest that
fractal-like structure encoding time-series is formed in state
space of neural dynamics of CA1.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was partly supported by Grant-in-Aids (no. 18019002 and 18047001) for Scientific Research on Priority

Total of 14 experimental rats (7- one-month old and 7- two-month old) were subjected to toluene intoxication during 40 days. Two days later after cessation of toluene intoxication
the ability of exploratory behavior and habituation to the environment of control and experimental rats of
different age groups was estimated in the open field. Regularities of motor response learning were studied under conditions
of Morris water tank seven days later after the cessation of toluene intoxication of control and experimental
rats of different age groups. The experiments were carried out in the medium poor in cues. In the process of training,
the location of platform to the start place did not change. A proper time (latent time) for searching of platform place
and trajectory of swimming in each trial were registered. The criterion of learning appears to be a direct swimming from
the start place to the platform in the consecutive four trials. Thus toluene intoxication of one-month old snuffer rats
induced a deterioration of motor response learning. Experimental animals reach a criterion of learning task on the 7th
day of training, while control group animals perform the task on the 3rd day. As compared to experimental animals,
an average indices of latent time were reliably low (U criterion of Wilcoxon-Mann Witney <italic>P</italic> = 0.05). One of the
reasons for the deterioration of learning processes may be considered a hyperactivity of experimental animals, clearly
manifested during their testing in the open field. Regularities of motor response learning and results of testing in the
open field of two-month old snuffer rats and control ones do not differ. The difference in the results obtained in two different
age groups is due to a high sensitivity of one-month old rats to the action of toluene or to suppression of compensatory
mechanisms of toluene action in two-month old rats.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7119" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EXCITOTOXIC LESIONS OF THE RAT MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX RESULT IN AN AUGMENTED

using an on-baseline CER procedure similar to that reported by [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The foot-shock US was sufficiently weak (0.4 mA,
0.5 s) to allow us to examine the acquisition of suppression over several conditioning trials, and the preexposure regime
was designed to yield little or no LI effect in sham operated control animals in order to maximise the opportunity
to observe an augmented LI effect in lesioned animals. As expected, we observed no difference in the rate of acquisition
of conditioned suppression to the preexposed (PE) and NPE stimuli in normal rats, but significantly slower acquisition to
the PE stimulus than to the NPE stimulus for rats with mPFC lesions. Possible implications of these results for the switching

pursuing other goals. Here, we present a novel procedure in rats, which may afford a more direct insight into this issue.
This procedure involves the use of a testing chamber in which the four walls are LCD screens, the displays of which
are computer controlled. As such the displays can be changed to provide information to the animal about its own position
(or state) within a particular behavioural chain. We examined the influence of post-training reinforcer devaluation
on lever press and magazine responding during the different stages of a simple levermagazine behavioural chain following
under- and over-training. Rats were trained in a Distal state to press a lever to transition to the Proximal state in which
a food pellet was delivered. Magazine entry to collect reward resulted in transition back to the Distal state. As each state
(Lever press/Food delivery) was accompanied by changes in the environment (Distal and Proximal contextual cues) we
were able to explicitly examine the selection of particular actions at particular states within the behavioural chain. Following
completion of three sessions (Under-trained) or ten sessions (Over-training) of lever press training, animals received
5-minute extinction tests in the proximal and distal states. Prior to extinction testing, half the animals received
pairings of the reinforcer with injections of lithium chloride (Devalued) and half the animals received injections of saline
(Non-devalued). The results suggest that the proximity between an action and reward, and between a behavioural state
and reward, both influence the decision to explore or exploit different elements of a behavioural sequence. Moreover, this
trade-off between the influence of the behavioural state and action changes across training. This novel procedure provides
a useful tool for further examining action selection in rats.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7354" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DISSECTING EXPLORATORY BEHAVIOUR: THE USE OF CUE-BASED SEARCHING STRATEGIES,

for examining spatial learning and memory. Since then, many elaborate studies, spanning a wide spectrum of areas
within neuroscience, have employed this straightforward task, demonstrating its broad versatility and ease of adaptation
to many protocols. However, despite innumerable findings since its introduction, the precise intricacies on how rodents
acquire information regarding the hidden platforms location remain ambiguous. Often, overarching navigational
strategies are reported when documenting rodent performance in the pool. These include those termed egocentric
(defining the relation of an object, goal, or location relative to the subject) or allocentric (defining the relation of an
object, goal, or location relative to another location, where this object is independent of the subject). Indeed previous
research has strongly implicated the use of allocentric processes in solving the MWM; particularly through the use of
visual distal cues in forming spatial relations with the platforms location. The current study demonstrates how animals
interact with these external visual cues during acquisition of the task. It is shown that several identified swimming
strategies, strongly associated with the cues, in combination with initial view-matching and egocentric guidance,
ultimately allows animals infer the hidden platforms location (via allocentric extrapolation) with training. Furthermore,
hippocampal BDNF expression is also shown to closely correlate with this acquisition, elucidating its role in
learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7377" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>OVERTRAINING IN RATS DOES NOT LEAD TO THE ACQUISITION OF A PROCEDURAL STRATEGY

Rats will use allocentric strategies over egocentric strategies in a hierarchical fashion. Two experiments were conducted
to investigate whether rats could be trained to use a procedural (egocentric) strategy to solve the MWM task in preference
to an allocentric one. In experiment 1, rats (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were trained in the light with full access to the distal cues to
find the hidden platform (fixed in the NE quadrant) from a fixed starting position (NW quadrant) over 4 days (4 trials/
day). Seven days post-acquisition animals were divided into 4 groups, retention was then tested by allowing them
to swim for 60 seconds in the platformless pool. Groups one and two were both re-tested in the light but group one (controllight)
was placed into the pool from the trained starting position (i.e., NW) and group two started the probe trial from a position 180&#x000b0; away from this (start-rotated (SR)- light). Groups three and four also consisted of a control and SR group but both of these groups were retested in the dark. It was expected that both SR groups would search less in the NE quadrant than the non-rotated groups and that the SRdark group would rely on a procedural strategy and search in the opposite quadrant (SW). There was no evidence of the rats adopting this strategy. Animals in the SR-light condition searched in the NE quadrant similar to the control-light group, while both dark groups remained in their respective starting position or swam around the pool in a thigmotactic fashion. To examine this further, a second experiment was conducted with the same four conditions but this time animals (<italic>n</italic> = 30) were trained for 12 days. Results indicated that despite overtraining there was again no evidence that rats adopted a procedural strategy. These findings would suggest that rats do not employ a procedural strategy when solving
the MWM task but rely heavily on distal cues to form spatial relations. In addition, the idea of a hierarchy of searching
strategies at an animals disposal is also questioned. Funding was provided by the SFI and IRCSET.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7430" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IMPAIRMENT IN A CUED VERSION MAY BE COMPENSATED BY PRE-TRAINING IN A SPATIAL

Wistar rats caused a specific and partial loss of substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) dopamine neurons, a partial
depletion of striatal dopamine, and a deficit to learn the intra-maze cued version of the Morris water maze. Pretraining
the SNpc rats in the spatial version of the water maze or simply maintaining the animals on the water
maze platform reversed this deficit. This improvement was even observed when the order of the extramaze cues presented
to the rats during pre-training of the spatial version was changed during training of the intra-maze cued version.
However, this deficit was not reversed either by maintaining the animals on the platform if the spatial cues were surrounded
and covered with a curtain or by swimming sessions in the maze without the escape platform and the curtain.
These findings suggest that none of the following elements alone, learned during the spatial task pre-training, could help
SNpc rats learn the intra-maze cued task: improvement of swimming skills or knowledge of the existence of the escape
platform; distance between the platform and the border of the pool; location of a particular extra-maze cue; relations
among extra-maze cues. However, the simultaneous presence of the escape platform and extra-maze cues (irrespective
of their relational configuration) during the pretraining sessions proved to be necessary for this improving effect to
occur.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Support from: CAPES, CNPq.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7533" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SPATIAL RELATIONAL LEARNING PERSISTS FOLLOWING NEONATAL HIPPOCAMPAL LESIONS IN

The aim of
the project is to elucidate the relationships between chromosomal loci and heritable behavioral traits related to memory
and learning processes by mapping quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that correlate with behavioral-cognitive abnormalities,
leading to the identification of genes which play a role in memory and learning processes and corresponding cognitive
disorders. In order to find QTLs, a large number of recombinant inbred (BxD) mouse lines are screened for behavioral
cognitive abnormalities using appetitive conditioning paradigms. The first step of training is a classical conditioning

Noradrenaline (NA) acts in the PFC during attention
as well as stressful situation and may modulate the higher cognitive functions. We tested the effect of NA on glutamatergic
synaptic transmission in rat PFC using intracellular recording from layer V pyramidal neurons. Bath-application
of NA (20 microM, 12.5 min) induced acute synaptic depression (&#x02212;26.9 &#x000b1; 5.6%) that was followed by long-term depression (LTD) (&#x02212;26.3 &#x000b1; 7.4% 40 min after NA washout,
<italic>n</italic> = 8). We characterized cellular mechanisms underlying this NA-induced LTD. First, NA-induced LTD involves
the activation of alpha1 and 2-adrenergic receptors, since prazosin (10 microM, alpha1-antagonist) or idazoxan (5 microM,
alpha2-antagonist) blocked this LTD (11.9 &#x000b1; 12.6% <italic>n</italic> = 8 and 17.6 &#x000b1; 7.9% <italic>n</italic> = 7, respectively). Second, induction of this LTD requires synaptic activation of NMDA-R, since DL-AP5 (100 microM), applied during NA application,
blocked LTD (6.5 &#x000b1; 11.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 8). Requirement of concurrent synaptic stimuli for LTD induction was suggested also by omission of test synaptic input during NA application which blocked LTD (3.7 &#x000b1; 12.6%, <italic>n</italic> = 6). Third, this LTD involves
PKC and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) cascades: application of specific PKC inhibitor RO31-8220
(0.4 microM) or ERK1/2 inhibitor PD98059 (20 microM) both blocked LTD (3.3 &#x000b1; 5.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 7 and 9.6 &#x000b1; 7.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 7, respectively). Postsynaptic inhibition of ERK1/2 by synthetic peptide injection also blocked LTD, suggesting that critical activation of ERK1/2 occurs postsynaptically (6.4 &#x000b1; 4.7%, <italic>n</italic> = 6). Finally, activation of ERK1/2 was quantified by western blot analysis. In conclusion, NA induces NMDA-Rdependent LTD in rat PFC that involves the activation of PKC and postsynaptic ERK1/2. Future in vivo research would reveal whether this NAinduced LTD represents a pathological state induced under stressful condition or it is part of physiological mnemonic processes.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by University of Paris VI and CNRS.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7732" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INDUCIBLE INHIBITION OF CREB PHOSPHORYLATION IMPAIRS MEMORY AND BLOCKS IN VIVO LONG TERM

mutation had been introduced. The mutation blocks CREB activation within the cell nucleus thus altering the CREB

In order to test the engagement of hippocampal subfields in an intact brain during the acquisition

an extended hippocampal system in the brain of rats (dentate gyrus, CA1, and entorhinal, postrhinal and retrosplenial
cortices). Two groups of rats were tested in a hippocampal-dependent task in a radial-arm maze, each trained to a different
extent, for either two or five sessions (Early or Late). Control groups were used, where each rat was yoked to an
experimental rat, and obtained the same number of rewards, visited the same number of maze arms and spent a similar
amount of time in the maze. Structural equation modeling analyses indicated dynamic network effective connectivity,
which was masked by the lack of Zif268-positive cell count differences between the conditions. The engagement of hippocampal
subfields in network activity displayed by the two trained groups was unequal. The tri-synaptic loop was bypassed
with training, as the dentate gyrus specifically became disengaged and reduced its neural influence. The differential
neural engagement of hippocampal subfields was supported by the finding of strong associations of performance measures
with dentate gyrus Zif268 expression in the Early but not the Late training group, and conversely with CA1 Zif268
expression in Late but not the Early training group. The findings of the current experiment suggest both a dynamic role
of hippocampal subfields in spatial memory function and a dynamic pattern of network activity, both evolving in parallel

with the dense anatomically connections with other structures known to support this class of memory, that is, the
hippocampal formation and the anterior thalamic nuclei. To date, lesion studies have been unable to define the specific
role of the retrosplenial cortex in spatial memory which might be, in part, due to the majority of lesion studies treating
the retrosplenial cortex as a unitary structure. The retrosplenial cortex can, however, be separated into two main
subregions: &#x0201c;granular&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;dysgranular&#x0201d;. These subregions differ both in terms of their morphology and anatomically
connectivity and it is, therefore, possible that they may also contribute differentially to spatial learning and memory. The
present study used immediate-early gene (IEG) expression to ascertain the specific involvement of these separate subregions
in spatial memory. Using IEGs as a marker of neuronal activity enabled us to examine all of the retrosplenial
subregions within the same animals, as well as allowing further differentiation within these subregions. Male, Dark
Agouti rats were either trained on a working memory task in an 8-arm radial maze or were &#x0201c;yoked&#x0201d; controls, matched
for sensorimotor stimulation in the radial-maze but without the mnemonic component. c-fos and zif268 expression was
quantified at different levels along the rostro-caudal axis of the granular a (Rga), granular b (Rgb) and dysgranular (Rdg)
cortices. Although there was increased IEG expression in all retrosplenial subregions (regardless of rostro-caudal level) in
the experimental compared to the control rats, the most pronounced difference was found in Rga. The present results
implicate all subregions of the retrosplenial cortex in spatial working memory in normal rats, but also highlight a more
specific contribution from retrosplenial granular a.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Support from: Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) UK.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7867" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A CONSISTENT LEFT WARD BIAS IN SPATIAL TASKS IN AN ANIMAL MODEL</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Regolin</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rugani</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vallortigara</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Department of General Psychology, University of Padova, Italy</aff><aff>Department of Psychology and BRAIN Centre for Neuroscience University of Trieste, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>A leftward bias has been reported for adapted versions of the cancellation task in two species of birds (i.e., the pigeon

How these two phenomena are related is still unclear. Recent studies
have revealed the importance of the immediate early gene zif268 in both LTP and spatial memory. First, deletion of
Zif268 in mice does not affect LTP induction and short term maintenance but impairs its long term maintenance. Second,
Zif268 mutant mice have a long term, but not a short term, memory deficit in spatial memory tasks. Our purpose
was to investigate place cell firing in Zif268 KO mice and examine its short and long term stability. Place cells were
recorded as mice explored a highly familiar environment (square) and were exposed to a new environment (circle),
a situation that usually induces formation of a new representation (remapping). Successive sessions were conducted
to examine whether place cells in Zif268 1) Maintained stable firing field in the square (S1, S2, S4), 2) Remapped in the
circle (S3), 3) Re-activated the circle representation after a 1H delay (short term memory), and 4) Re-activated the circle
representation after a 24H delay (long term memory). We found that place cells in Zif268 maintained stable firing fields
in the square (S1, S2) and remapped in the circle (S3). Surprisingly, a proportion of cells was unable to re-establish the
familiar representation in the square afterwards (S4). Lastly, both short term and long term stability of firing fields were
affected in Zif268. The results suggest that the Zif268 gene is involved in the formation and maintenance of place celldependent
spatial memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7931" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INTERACTION OF ARENA SHAPE WITH OTHER CUES IN THE CONTROL OF PLACE CELL FIRING LOCATION IN

As a contextual cue, the shape of the
environment can influence whether a place cell fires or not, with remapping seen between two differently shaped arenas
in the same spatial location (Lever, Wills et al. 2002; Paz-Villagran, Save et al. 2004). However as a geometric cue, the
positional control of place fields by arena shape is less clearly defined. Following training in an environment where the distal
cues are stable relative to the orientation of the arena, there is evidence that distal cues dominate over arena shape
in the control of place field location when the two are subsequently rotated relative to each other (Cressant, Muller et al.
2002). However there is evidence that in situations whereby distal cues are perceived as unstable, they gain less control
over place field location relative to other cues (Knierim, Kudrimoti et al. 1995). In the current study, place cells were
recorded in a rectangular arena that was rotated from trial to trial. The findings indicated that arena shape can control the
position of place fields in a situation whereby distal cues and arena entry point were unstable across trials. Furthermore
there is also evidence for interaction between arena geometry and other cues in the orientation of place fields in this
rotationally symmetrical environment.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e7966" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PREFERENCE FOR FACE-LIKE STIMULI IN AN ANIMAL MODEL</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rosa Salva</surname><given-names>O.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Romor</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Regolin</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Department of General Psychology, University of Padova, Padova, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>There has long been a debate as to whether infants preference for looking at face-like stimuli with respect to non facelike ones (Goren, Sarty and Wu, Pediatrics, 1975) is determined by the presence of an innate schematic representation

Twenty-four hours later another three trials were given. On day 1, all untreated mice employed a spatial strategy, while 25 percent

We conclude that (a) the stress hormone corticosterone modulates the use of spatial and stimulus-response learning strategies, (b) stress and
stress hormones affect both the used strategy and the latencies to the exit hole, as spatial learners of the corticosterone

affect the learning strategy and latency during acquisition without changing memory consolidation and retrieval.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work was supported by grants DFG GRK 1389/1 and NWO DN 95 &#x02013; 420.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8154" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>BEHAVING IN GEOMETRIC MAZES WITHOUT A GEOMETRIC MODULE: A MODEL OF INTERACTION

training) tend to chose the larger quantity, performing an adaptive choice consistent with the predictions of the &#x0201c;optimal
foraging strategy&#x0201d; theory. The ability to &#x02018;go for more&#x02019; has been recognized in evolutionarily remote species, such
as fish and salamanders as well as in human infants and in non-human primates. Choice of the larger amount can be
considered as a rudimentary mathematical ability, although it is still unclear its relation to the systems of categorization of
experiences from which, in humans, the concept of number arises. We investigated, in seven adult subjects of Bombina
orientalis, spontaneous choices for different numerosities of Tenebrio molitor larvae (1 vs 2; 2 vs 3; 3 vs 4; 4 vs 8) as a
first evidence of numerical discrimination ability within this species. Subjects could freely approach any of the two groups
of larvae that were placed in front of them. The data showed that bombinas discriminated the two quantities and chose
the larger amount when faced with sets of 1 vs 2 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0009) and 2 vs 3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0489), but not when the paired numbers were 3 vs 4 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.4816). Though, four items was not the absolute limit to discrimination as, in the case of 4 vs 8 mealworms, when the ratio between the two numerosities was large enough, bombinas were capable of significantly choosing the larger set (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0059). These results are consistent with those obtained in salamanders and also show striking similarities with the performance of monkeys and human infants. Overall, in a comparative perspective, the existence of an archaic non-linguistic systems for numerical discrimination seems plausible. Whether the cognitive mechanisms
at the basis of the observed abilities are the same in all the species remains at present an open issue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8239" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DUAL EFFECTS OF TAURINE SUPPLEMENTATION ON VISUAL DISCRIMINATION TASK IN MICE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Suge</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l119">

in the central nervous system of mammals, has
been shown to be essential for the development. There were
several reports that taurine supplementation in early life induced
neuronal and behavioural changes. In this study, the
effects of taurine supplementation at different times on visual
discrimination task in mice were examined. Male mice
were assigned into four groups by the supplementation periods.
(i) Lifelong: Taurine dissolved in distilled water (0.12%)
was provided as drinking water. In the perinatal to early
post-natal period, the taurine was given to through subjects'
mothers. After the weaning subject uptake the taurine
by itself as the drinking water by the end of the experiment.
(ii) Pre-weaning: Subjects were exposed to the taurine
by the weaning, (iii) Post-weaning: from after the weaning.
(iv) Control: Subjects were drinking distilled water throughout
the experiment. For acquisition of the task, the Lifelong
group needed longer period than the Control group.
In the Post-weaning group, conversely, mice learned the task
quicker than the control. The Pre-weaning group showed no
difference compared with the control. Thus, the retardation
of the task acquisition occurred with the supplementation in
early and adult life. At the same time, the taurine supplementation
after weaning improved the visual discrimination
learning. We suggest that timing of the supplementation affected
the effect of the taurine supplementation in adult on
the learning and the perinatal-early postnatal period might
be &#x0201c;sensitive period&#x0201d; for the retardation of learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8346" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ROLE OF PARIETAL CORTEX OF THE RAT IN TWO TASKS INVOLVING DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Svoboda</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l125">

However, cue
manipulations such as rotation or transition allow to assess their control exerted over behavioral processes and to examine
underlying brain mechanisms. We used Long-Evans rats with lesion of parietal cortex in two behavioral tasks taking
place in dynamic environment. Both of them were conducted on elevated circular arena (<italic>d</italic> = 80 cm), in 20 min daily sessions. At first, the rats were trained 6 days in Robot Avoidance Task (RAT), in which the rat must keep safe distance at
least 25 cm from a programmable robot to avoid a mild footshock. The robot was programmed to move straigth forward
(15 cm/s) until it hit the wall, then it waited for 15 s, turned 1800 to 90 degrees, and ran again. Two weeks after the first
experiment, food-deprived rats were trained to asymptotic performance in a modified version of Place Avoidance (PA)
task to search for randomly dispersed pellets while avoiding a small sector on the arena. Since the sector is not directly
perceivable rats can remember its position either in coordinate frame of the arena, or in frame anchored to cues outside
the arena. By slow arena rotation under extinction condition, we may examine which of these two frames well-learned rats
prefer. Results showed that parietal rats (<italic>n</italic> = 8) were slightly but not significantly facilitated (<italic>p</italic> = 0.10) in learning RAT when compared to controls (<italic>n</italic> = 8). In addition, they did not differ in locomotion nor in thigmotaxis. The PA task revealed that parietal rats chose arena frame more frequently than controls, though both groups learned the task at the
same rate. Our results do not support data of other authors obtained in static environment tasks that suggested parietal
cortex would play a role in processing proximal spatial cues.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Supported by GACR grants 309/06/1231 and 206/05/H012, by MSMT project 1M0517, and by AV0Z50110509.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8421" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ENTORHINAL CORTEX LESIONS PRODUCE DELAY-DEPENDENT DEFICITS IN HABITUATION

display a delay-dependent retention deficit in spatial and non spatial learning tasks. In this study, we tested the effects of EC
lesions in an object exploration task involving habituation, spatial and non spatial memory. Habituation to a configuration
of 4 objects was examined during 6 successive sessions separated by a 4 min or a 10 min inter session interval. Following
habituation, a spatial change was made by displacing one object and the reaction to change was measured after a
30 sec, 4 min or 10 min interval. Lastly, a non-spatial change was made by substituting a familiar object by a novel object
and the reaction to change was measured after a 4 min or a 10 min interval. The results showed that EC-lesioned rats exhibited
a deficit of habituation at the 10 min but not the 4- min interval. They exhibited a deficit in the reaction to spatial
change at all intervals and were not impaired in the reaction to non spatial change. The results suggest that the EC 1) plays
a role in non associative memory processes, 2) is differentially involved in habituation and spatial memory processes, 3) is
not involved in non spatial memory processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8450" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>STRUCTURAL REARRANGEMENTS WITHIN HIPPOCAMPAL-CORTICAL NETWORKS MEDIATE

MSt receives dopaminergic and glutamatergic afferents, and a coincidence between excitatory amino acid
related and dopaminergic inputs are necessary for memory consolidation. Daisley et al. (1998) showed that the extracellular
glutamate level in the MSt is sensitive to stress. In the present study we used both one trial aversive and serial reinforcement
conditioning combined with in vivo microdialysis to monitor the changes of the extracellular levels of different
amino acids. Microdialysis probes were stereotaxically implanted into the medial striatum of one-day-old chicks.
The birds were then trained either by the one-trial passive avoidance paradigm or by a combination of operant conditioning
using water reinforcement, habituation learning and taste aversion learning. As conditional stimuli, coloured
beads were presented to the individuals, and the number of pecks was recorded during the experiments. The occasional
handling of chicks was also recorded as a possible stress source. Microdialysis samples were collected during the experiment
at 15 minute intervals, and analysed later by HPLC. Our results showed that stress elicited a marked elevation of
the level of aspartate and glutamate but not those of other amino acids. Such changes were not observed in anesthetised
birds. This effect increased the variance of baseline values and masked most of the behaviour related responses. However,
a slight but significant decrease of aspartate and glutamate occurred after the presentation of the aversive stimulus. We
find it potentially meaningful to detect neurochemical correlates of behaviour by in vivo microdialysis in the MSt of
freely moving chicks. Stress could be a potent factor affecting the levels of excitatory amino acids and thereby the NMDA
and non-NMDA receptor mediated consolidation of memory.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Grant sponsor: ETT119/2006.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8601" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LEARNING-INDUCED POST-SYNAPTIC ENHANCEMENT OF EXCITATORY AND INHIBITORY

Thus, homeostatic plasticity must occur in neurons and neuronal networks under various physiological processes, such as learning
and memory. To fully understand how large neuronal ensembles undergo permanent changes while maintaining their functionality, three components of the total neuronal excitability and the manner by which their action is combined must be fully described: the excitatory synaptic drive mediated mainly by glutamate receptors, the intrinsic neuronal excitability, and synaptic inhibition mediated by GABA receptors. The purpose of the present study was to explore if and how excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs onto pyramidal neurons are co-modified after olfactory learning to balance each other's effects.</p><p>Rats were trained in four-arm maze to discriminate between odors in pairs. As previously shown, rats require 6&#x02013;8
consecutive training days to learn to distinguish between a pair of odors, but to learn a second pair of odors only requires
1&#x02013;2 training days (rule learning). Piriform cortex brain slices were prepared 4&#x02013;5 days after rulelearning. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were obtained from layer II pyramidal neurons at 300 &#x000b0;C, with Vm held at &#x02212;80 mV.

Thus, the single quantum increases after rulelearning. Accordingly, the averaged amplitude of the spontaneous events was significantly larger in neurons form trained rats. In contrast, the frequency of spontaneous events was similar in both groups,
indicating that the probability of release is not modified after learning. To evaluate changes in inhibitory synaptic transmission,
intracellular recordings with sharp electrode were made from layer II pyramidal neurons. IPSPs were evoked by
electrical stimulations applied in layer III, in the presence of APV and DNQX, to block glutamatergic synaptic transmission.

exposure to an adapting stimulus. This effect has been shown to occur at all levels of visual processing. Recent studies
have applied an aftereffects paradigm to the investigation of the perception of facial categories, using morphed images
that create a continuum between two extremes, and suggested that aftereffects are unlikely to derive only from adaptation
to low-level features of the images. Given the particular status of faces as stimuli, it is not clear whether adaptation
aftereffects are present in perception of other classes of items. Even if adaptation to simple geometrical shapes
has been described, this paradigm has never been applied to complex natural images. The first aim of this work was to investigate
whether the adaptation aftereffects can be extended to perception and categorization of objects. Using a morphing
technique, we morphed images of animate (animals) and inanimate objects, creating continua of within category (e.g.,
cat-cat) and between category (e.g., cat-rabbit) stimuli. In order to test whether the similarity between the extremes of
the continua is related to the after effects, we obtained a measure of perceptual similarity for the extremes of each pair, investigating
in separate sessions the role of shape, texture and meaning. We found significant aftereffects in perceptual discrimination
of the morphed images after adaptation to the extremes of the morph continuum. This effect seems to be
modulated by the type of similarity rating that the subjects are requested to perform before the adaptation task, suggesting
a role of attention to particular feature of the images in the after effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8692" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PREDICTING FACIAL EXPRESSIONS: ADAPTATION AFTER EFFECTS OF CHANGING EXPRESSIONS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>van Rijsbergen</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l133">

Economics
typically assumes that when delaying gratification the lower weight given to future benefits, the discount rate, declines
exponentially. However there is a substantial body of evidence that it declines more rapidly, that is, hyperbolically.
Hyperbolic discounting has been utilised to explain a range of phenomena in the behavioural economics literature, particularly
in the areas of procrastination (O'Donoghue and Rabin 1999; Brocas and Carrillo 2001). A further issue that
has derived from this literature is whether time preferences are domain specific, with both rates of trade and decision
processes differing across the domain of the decision. In terms of the neural bases of such decisions, McClure et al.
(2004) reported differential activations in limbic, prefrontal and posterior parietal regions when immediate and delayed
monetary rewards were contrasted. Here we present behavioral and high-density EEG/ERP data from a task in which
participants were asked to make decisions about financial rewards or their health over short and long time-horizons. Participants
(<italic>n</italic> = 15) made a button-press response to their preference for an immediate or delayed gain (financial or
health), with either a large or small discrepancy existing between these alternatives. Waveform components elicited during
the task differentiated between conditions, while dipole source analysis was employed to identify possible cortical
generators of the scalp-recorded potentials. This paper is the first to examine potential neurological mechanisms underpinning
domain-specific hyperbolic discounting processes, and elucidates on the behavioral and neurocognitive operations
involved in this form of decision making.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8818" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HIGH-DENSITY ERPS MAY DIFFERENTIATE CONSOLIDATION FROM RECONSOLIDATION

The evidence in favour of the Consolidation Theory is widespread, both on a cellular and systems level. Research
has indicated that consolidation and reconsolidation employ similar mechanisms; both the consolidation and reconsolidation
of memory require protein synthesis and glutaminergic input, and both seem to be associated with the hippocampal
formation. Despite this, other data argue that the two concepts are entirely separate and individual processes. A task
was devised specifically to compare reconsolidation of an existing memory trace and the new consolidation of additional
information. An initial study block involved the presentation of sixteen visual pairedassociates. In a subsequent study
block, half of the study pairs were combined with an additional stimulus to form a triplet, while the other eight pairs
were not associated with a supplementary stimulus. In a final test block, paired versus non-paired stimuli were presented
for yes/no recognition. The presentation of the original pair (i.e., reconsolidated memory) was contrasted with presentation
of the &#x0201c;new&#x0201d; associates with either element of the original pair (i.e., newly consolidated memory). 128-channel EEG
was recorded for each stimulus type and BESA source localisation was employed to identify neural generators associated
with the task. Analysis of electrophysiological components elicited for reconsolidated versus newly-consolidated
pairs revealed modulation of the memory-related posterior components P3 (250&#x02013;400 ms), N2 (150&#x02013;250 ms), and P1 (100&#x02013;150 ms). These findings help to elucidate the nature of consolidation and reconsolidation processes and address the question of whether they constitute similar or distinct processes.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8869" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A STUDY OF THE NEURAL CORRELATES OF SOURCE MEMORY RETRIEVAL IN YOUNG AND

with cognitive decline in the elderly, and appear to be more indicative of age-related memory impairment than disruption
of item memory. An Opposition Procedure developed by Jacoby and colleagues (Jennings &#x00026; Jacoby, 1997) tests this
source memory capacity by drawing on repetition errors in a word recall task in which novel words are presented repeatedly
at 3 differing lags (0, 4 and 16 trials). This task is sensitive to source memory dysfunction, with older adults
being found to produce significantly more errors in repetition than healthy younger adults. In this study, we recorded
128-channel EEG from normal healthy participants (<italic>N</italic> = 18; age 20&#x02013;30) and healthy older adults (<italic>N</italic> = 18; aged 60&#x02013;70) while they executed the Opposition Task. Behavioral results showed that accuracy decreased significantly (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for lag 4 and 16 trials compared to lag 0 trials, with an associated
significant increase in reaction times (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) for the longer lag conditions, replicating the results found by
Jennings &#x00026; Jacoby (1997) across age groups. Older adults showed significantly lower scores and longer RTs than the
young adult group. ERP results showed differences in component amplitudes between the age groups and between conditions,
with greater frontal scalp positivity in young adults for correct responses to targets over other conditions and
greater parietal scalp positivity for all correct responses over incorrect responses. Source analysis showed dipoles near prefrontal

The current study consisted of two experiments designed to examine encoding and retrieval of spatial information using high-density electroencephalography. A computer based &#x0201c;spatial grid task&#x0201d; was used to present stimuli in both experiments. Experiment
1 investigated the discriminatory aspects of a parietal P1 and its sensitivity to rotations of an object array. Twenty participants
memorized the locations of objects in an environment. During the recognition test the environment was rotated by
90 degrees left or right or 180 degrees, which required participants to reorient to the new viewpoint. The P1 accompanied
these rotations, and after rotation to the left or right, an increase in the amplitude of the P1 was seen in the contralateral
hemisphere. We demonstrate a human ability to perceive orientation within an environment, as evidenced by this electrophysiological component's hemispherical dissociation for left/right rotations. Experiment 2 examined whether the coding of spatial location occurred spontaneously, without explicit instruction. Eighteen participants volunteered for an
object recognition task in which old/new judgements were required at the test phase. &#x0201c;Old&#x0201d; objects appeared in either
their studied location or elsewhere on the spatial grid, resulting in significant differences in the ERP. Behavioural and
electrophysiological differences are reported with N2 and P3 component latency negatively affected by relocation. Componentry
in the waveform for correctly located objects were &#x0223c;100 ms earlier than for incorrectly located objects and distractors.
Dipole source models are provided for both experiments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8933" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TOWARDS A PHYSIOLOGICAL THEORY OF ABSTRACT LEARNING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rey</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l141">

In the past,
Same/Different (SD) discrimination, the simplest form of abstract learning, was thought to have language training as
a necessary condition. However, experimental evidence have shown that this task cannot only be solved by humans, but
also by chimpanzees, rhesus and capuchin monkeys, and pigeons. In addition, recent neurophysiological data suggests
that neurons in prefrontal cortex of rhesus monkey code abstract rules. Despite these evidence, how neural networks are
able to learn abstract rules is largely unknown.</p><p>We propose a minimal model that is able to learn the SD task. The model is composed of an input layer, working
memory cells, SD cells and response neurons. Working memory cells are connected to SD cells through depressing
synapses. Each different stimulus activates a defined subset of working memory cells. The synapses impinging on the SD
cells that correspond to activated working memory cells become depressed. A further presentation of the same stimulus
will elicit a lower response from these cells indicating that the same stimulus was presented, irrespective to its particular
features. In contrast when the stimulus are different, the synapses are not depressed, and the SD cells response are not
attenuated. Response neurons pool these neurons to provide the correct response. The model is minimal in the sense that
all its components are already described in the literature, although without explicit mention to its relevance for this task.
The model provides also a basic building block upon more complicated abstract tasks can be accomplished, such as conceptual
matching to sample, learning sequences of stimuli, etc.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This project is supported in part by ANPCYT: PICT 11990, UBACYT I007 and CONICET: PIP 5876.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e8991" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A SENSE-LINKAGE FOR METRIC AND LANDMARK INFORMATION IN ANIMALS' SPATIAL REORIENTATION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vallortigara</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l142">

We present, however, a simple modification to the standard hebbian learning rule that overcomes this
shortage, enabling the storage of any set of correlated representations under the single assumption of independence
across neurons, which we further discuss. In comparison with previous studies, the rule uses local information rather
than global measures of activity, increasing its biological plausibility. The secondary effects of this rule condense into
a new and remarkable property of associative networks: the robustness of a given memory is inverse to the information it
carries. This theoretical discovery can be extrapolated to explain functional and architectural properties of the cortex. In
first place, we use the robustness rule to derive an explanation of category-specific impairments in the semantic memory
system as a consequence of the information distribution across categories, in line with previous qualitative proposals
[<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In second place, we show that correlated memories cannot be acquired on the basis of a one-shot learning
paradigm, which meets the proposal [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and posterior experimental finding [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] that the quintessence of one-shot
learning in cortex&#x02014;the episodic memory loop&#x02014;is equipped with an un-correlating mechanism (Dentate Gyrus acting on the CA3 memory-layer of hippocampus), possibly the mammalian strategy to avoid such an incompatibility.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B30"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Devlin</surname><given-names>JT</given-names></name><name><surname>Russell</surname><given-names>RP</given-names></name><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>MH</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Is there an anatomical basis for category-specificity?

Where models are explicitly
based on biology, they often take a modular approach to the functions of the cortex, addressing the functional role of only
one cortical structure at a time. The premise for the work presented in this paper is that a useful understanding of the
contribution of cortex to cognition can be gained from taking a unitary view of cortical function, regarding all cortex as
computationally alike. This paper presents a model of cortex that was designed to include biologically observed properties
common to all neocortex. The model was then applied to a variety of tasks which are known to engage the neocortex.
These include the development of representations in V1, perceptual learning tasks and stimuli identification and recognition.
The model proposes a new means of understanding cortical function that ties learning and behaviour to synptic
placticity and neuronal activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9260" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GUESSING IN THE BRAIN</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Giorgio</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rosemarie</surname><given-names>N.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Institut des Sciences Congnitives, Bron, France</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>We used fMRI for investigating human mental processes related to reasoning about others' behavior.

The major
neurophysiological response indexing &#x0201c;sense&#x0201d; is the N400, a late event-related brain response larger for senseless materials (e.g., meaningless pseudowords) than for matched meaningful words. More recently, however, early differences have also been recorded, using Magneto- and Electro-Encephalography (MEG and EEG)&#x02014;for example, in the Mismatch Negativity (MMN, latency 100&#x02013;250 ms).

used it to simulate brain processes of early language acquisition. The network was repeatedly confronted with activation
patterns and allowed to adapt by means of Hebbian (longtermpotentiation and depression)mechanisms: we observed
the formation of input-specific neuronal circuits, i.e., sets of strongly interconnected neurons distributed over a range of
areas which responded only to known patterns (&#x0201c;words&#x0201d;). The trained model was then used to simulate the neurophysiological
response of the language cortex to words and senseless pseudowords stimuli. We found that variation of
the amount of global inhibition of the network (which we interpret as the model correlate of attention) modulated the
simulated brain response to words and pseudowords, producing either an N400- or an MMN-like response depending
on the amount of global inhibition (or available attentional resources).</p><p>Our model (1) demonstrates the viability of purely Hebbian, associative learning in a multi-layered network architecture,

clear predictions on the effects of attention on latency and magnitude of ERPs to lexical items. Such predictions have
been confirmed by recent experimental evidence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9430" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MEMORY TRACE STABILIZATION LEADS TO LARGE-SCALE CHANGES IN THE RETRIEVAL NETWORK:

However, little is known about the neural correlates of trace stabilization, especially in humans. In the
present fMRI study, we trained subjects on associating a face (40 faces in each condition) to a given location (one of the
eight locations on the screen). The task of the subjects at test was to retrieve the associated location when a face cue was
presented. We contrasted the retrieval activity of two memory conditions, one learned in a massed style and tested on
the same day of learning (i.e., the labile condition) and another learned in a spaced scheme over the course of one week
(i.e., the stabilized condition). In accord with our expectation, both sets of associations were retrieved equally well;
however, the retrieval of stabilized association was faster (stabilized: reaction time = 936 &#x000b1; 26.1 ms; labile: reaction time
= 1029 &#x000b1; 35.0 ms; <italic>n</italic> = 22, <italic>t</italic> = 4.520, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Cuedrecall
of stabilized as compared to labile associations was accompanied by increased activity in the precuneus, the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex, the bilateral temporal pole and left temporo-parietal junction. Conversely, memory representational
areas such as the fusiform gyrus for faces and the posterior parietal cortex for locations did not change their
activity with stabilization. Thus stabilization is expressed as changes in regions linking the representational areas. The
activation changes in the precuneus, which also showed increase in connectivity with the fusiform area with stabilization,
are likely to reflect a more direct retrieval of the spatial components of the task. As for the activation increase in
the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, the change might reflect the succession of the hippocampal role in linking distributed
neocortical representations.</p></body><floats-group><fig id="fig191-1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><graphic xlink:href="NP2007-23250.008"/></fig></floats-group></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9528" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MEMORY TRACE STABILIZATION IS REFLECTED BY CHANGES IN THETA AND GAMMA ACTIVITY:

Little is known about how this oscillatory activity changes when memories stabilizes with time and training. We used magnetoencephalography (MEG) to investigate the changes in neocortical activity with memory stabilization. 22 subjects were trained on two sets of face-place associations. The first set was learned distributed over the week prior to the MEG measurements (&#x02018;stabilized&#x02019;) and the second set was intensively learned just prior to the measurement (&#x02018;labile&#x02019;). In the retrieval sessions the subjects had to recall the place associated with a given face. Retrieval was faster for stabilized than labile associations but equally accurate. The eventrelated fields (ERFs) showed a faster onset for stabilized associations in frontal sensors. Additionally sustained ERFs were larger for labile than stabilized associations over frontal, temporal and parietal areas. Time-frequency representations of power revealed an increase in gamma band (60&#x02013;120 Hz) activity around the parieto-occipital sulcus during recall. This increase was higher for labile than stabilized associations. Theta power (&#x0223c;6 Hz) also increased during recall spreading from posterior to anterior regions. The increase was higher for stabilized than labile associations, first over right temporal and later over right parieto-central areas. The faster recall and smaller in ERFs for stabilized associations point to neuronal processes for recall becoming more efficient with
memory stabilization. Our data suggests that the recall of labile face-space associations relies on a strategy engaging visual
areas (e.g., &#x02018;mind's eye&#x02019;) as reflect by the gamma activity. Retrieval of stabilized memories relies to a higher degree on
the classical association areas in temporal and parietal areas as reflected by the theta activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9590" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECTS OF AGING ON ATTENTIONAL MODULATION OF CORTICAL PROCESSING</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eve</surname><given-names>D.

Given that the efficiency of selective attention is presumed to decline in the course
of normal aging, the present study examined how the processing of irrelevant information differs between younger
and older adults. Participants performed a gender judgment task comprised of superimposed face (target) and house
(ignored) stimuli. It was hypothesized that older adults would unintentionally encode more task irrelevant (house)
information. Some of the stimuli were presented multiple times non-consecutively, whereas others were presented only
once. On a subsequent implicit recognition test, participants matched the previously seen faces with either the correct
(previously seen) house or a novel house. Performance accuracy on the implicit recognition test provided a measure
of unintentional encoding of irrelevant (house) information during the gender judgment task. Older adults exhibited significantly
better accuracy on the implicit recognition test compared to the younger group for the repeated irrelevant
stimuli from the gender judgment task. However, there was no difference detected in explicit recognition for the faces or
houses between groups. The results suggest that older adults enhanced implicit knowledge of irrelevant information reflect
impaired selective attentional control. We are currently using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine
potential age-related changes in attentional modulation of cortical processing in the parahippocampal place area
(PPA). We also hypothesize that these results will reveal attentional network changes that predict the behavioural correlates
of impaired selective attention in older adults. Supported by: Canadian Institutes of Health Research grant to

A simple task has been proposed to test the independence of these sub-systems: the Attention Network
Test (ANT), in which targets falling above or below fixation are presented under different cueing conditions (Spatially
valid Cue, SC, Central neutral Cue, CC, No Cue, NC), surrounded by Congruent or Incongruent Flankers (CF, IF).
Previous behavioral studies using ANT found interactions between voluntary orienting and executive control systems
(during orienting, SC, the flankers effect was smaller than when non-orienting), although the anatomical counterpart
of this interaction has not been clearly indicated. To investigate the spatial and temporal links between orienting
and executive control we administered the ANT to 19 adults while recording their EEG from 128 channels. Offline grandaverage
ERP and Difference Waves (DW) were computed as a function of task (SC, CC, NC) and congruency (CF,
IF). We also carried out source reconstruction by means of LORETA. In accordance with literature, task and congruency
exerted an interactive effect. LORETA computed for the SCCC DW showed the activation of both the areas considered
responsible for attentional orienting and of Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC, BA 32), currently thought to be involved
in conflict resolution and monitoring processes. Particularly, the ACC activation already arose during C1 latency range
(60&#x02013;100 ms after target presentation) and maximized during frontal N2 and P300 time range (750&#x02013;1100 ms). We did not observe this pattern in the CC-NC DW LORETA. Taken together, these results suggest a plausible neural correlate of
the lower cost for incongruency in SC, in which the conflict monitoring system is plausibly pre-activated by the orienting
network.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9675" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HOW TO GIVE ELMAN BP SOME REINFORCEMENT FLAVOUR</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gr&#x000fc;ning</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Cognitive Neuroscience Sector - SISSA, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The back-propagation (BP) training scheme is widely used for training network models besides its well known technical and biological short-comings. We present a method to make the BP training scheme more acceptable from a biological
and cognitive point of view in cognitively motivated prediction tasks overcoming one of its major drawbacks.
Traditionally, recurrent neural networks in symbolic time series prediction (e.g., language) are trained with gradient
decent based learning algorithms, notably with backpropagation (BP) through time. A major drawback for the
biological plausibility of BP is that it is a supervised scheme in which a teacher has to provide a fully specified target
answer. Yet, agents in natural environments often receive a summary feed-back about the degree of success or failure
only, a view adopted in reinforcement learning schemes. We show that for simple recurrent networks in prediction
tasks for which there is a probability interpretation of the network's output vector, Elman BP can be reimplemented
as a reinforcement learning scheme for which the expected weight updates agree with the ones from traditional
Elman BP.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Andr&#x000e9; Gr&#x000fc;ning: &#x0201c;Backpropagation as reinforcement in prediction tasks&#x0201d;, Neural Computation 2007, accepted.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9698" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TYPES OF APHASIA IN CHILDREN WITH TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vukovic</surname><given-names>M.

Clayton and Dickinson (1998) as the memory for information about &#x02018;where&#x02019; a unique event or episode took place,
&#x02018;what&#x02019; occurred during the episode, and &#x02018;when&#x02019; the episode happened. We developed non-verbal test of episodic-like
memory for human presented on computer. The test consists of a presentation and a testing phase. In the presentation
phase, the subject is shown a computer screen with several abstract pictures on predefined places on the right part of the
screen and an empty open chest on the left. S/he is instructed to drag, using the computer mouse pointer, the pictures from
the predefined places in a given order slowly into the chest. The subjects should memorize both the order and the position
of each picture. After about 10 minutes break, the subject should drag the pictures in the same order to the correct
position. Successively, memory for position and order of three, five and seven pictures was tested. We evaluated separately
the errors in giving order of the pictures, position of the pictures and order of the predefined positions. Comparison
was made among groups diagnosed with non-amnestic, amnestic single domain and amnestic multidomain subtypes
of MCI, early stage of AD and a control group. The nonamnestic MCI subjects were impaired in the order of the object,
while the amnestic multidomain MCI subjects were impaired in the object position. The amnestic multidomain and
AD patients were impaired in both. These results can be useful in predicting the outcome of different MCI subtypes.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Supported by GACR grants 309/05/0693 and 309/06/1231, MSMT CR 1M0517 and research project AV0Z50110509.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9842" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE ROLE OF POSTERIOR THALAMUS FOR OUR CONTROL OF UPRIGHT BODY POSTURE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ticini</surname><given-names>L.

The patients have a disturbed perception of their own body orientation. They experience their upright body posture
tilted about 20&#x000b0; to the ipsilesional side. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether posterior thalamic
strokes in patients with pusher syndrome cause abnormal perfusion in sub/cortical areas remote from the site of the
lesion. In a group of four patients with pusher syndrome and six controls, we studied the pattern of (structurally intact
but) dysfunctional sub/cortical tissue induced by these strokes using perfusion-weighted MR imaging (PWI). The
group analyses revealed that patients with pusher syndrome did not show distinctive perfusion abnormalities in addition
to their lesions in the posterior thalamus. We conclude that pusher syndrome is not caused by dysfunction of structurally
intact sub/cortical areas but rather is caused by the neuronal loss in the posterior thalamus itself. The finding is consistent
with recent anatomical studies that suggested a fundamental role of the posterior thalamus for our control of upright
body posture.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9925" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A COMPARISON OF COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS BETWEEN NON-DEMENTED PARKINSON'S DISEASE PATIENTS OF DIFFERENT MOTOR SUBTYPES</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lyros</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l163">

Two major
clinical subtypes of PD have been identified; the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) - dominant subtype
and the tremor-dominant (TD) subtype based on the relative predominance of these symptoms, with the remaining
PD patients classified as &#x0201c;indeterminate&#x0201d; subtype. The PIGD subtype has been shown to be associated with worse clinical
prognosis and higher occurrence of dementia compared to the non-PIGD subtypes. In the present study, two groups
of nondemented PD patients, one composed of 15 PIGD patients and one composed of 15 non-PIGD ones, as well as
a group of 15 healthy controls performed a set of tasks to evaluate different aspects of cognition previously found to
be affected in PD. All groups were matched regarding potential confounders of neuropsychological performance. Patients
were assessed on treatment with levodopa, therefore the scores obtained are thought to represent residual nondopaminergic
deficiency. Statistical analysis revealed no significant differences between the two groups of patients in
the performances in any of the administered tests, indicating against the presence of major differences in cognitive
functions between non-demented PIGD-dominant PD patients and their counterparts to account for the higher incidence
of dementia in the former group. However, there was a tendency towards a differential pattern of cognitive dysfunction
when each patient group was compared to controls. The PIGD group had slower performance in a test of psychomotor
speed and cognitive flexibility, while the non-PIGD group provided worse scores in measures of verbal learning and visuospatial
perception. Pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) lesions for the PIGD group and cerebello-thalamocortical activation
for the tremor-dominant variant that mainly compounds the non-PIGD group are primarily considered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e9979" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TASK-INDEPENDENT NEGLECT IN NEAR AND FAR SPACE&#x02013;A COMPARISON OF LINE BISECTION AND

To
date, the effect of distance on the severity of neglect has been shown mainly with line bisection paradigms only (Halligan,
1991; Keller, 2005) and it is still unclear whether neglect for near and far space represents a task independent phenomenon.
In the present study, 35 right hemisphere damaged patients with and without neglect were recruited. All the
patients performed a cancellation and a line bisection task in near (40 cm) and far (350 cm) space respectively. The stimuli
were presented in front of each subject and aligned with the body midline. The tasks were performed by using a pen in
near space and a laser pointer in far space. The cancellation task (bell test) required to detect 35 targets along with 280
distractors whereas in the bisection task patients were asked to mark the middle of three lines placed respectively on the
right, on the centre and on the left of the display. The results showed that in both tasks, the performance of the neglect
patients was significantly worse compared to patients without neglect and that space distance affected only the performance
of the neglect group. In fact, the performance of the latter improved significantly in far space compared to near
space irrespective of the type of task. The results suggest a dissociation between neglect for near and far space. Thus it
is possible that different neuronal networks may be recruited for allocating attention to objects within and beyond grasping
distance. Moreover, the similar pattern of reduced neglect in far as compared to near space in both tasks indicates
task-independent attention processing within near and far space.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10008" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>GROUP ANALYSIS OF POLARITY DIFFERENCES IN PATTERN-ONSET VEPS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Del Zotto</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l165">

object-based stimulus features. The goal of the research was to investigate early attention effects by recording patternonset
VEPs to familiar objects in a conjoined space-based. Possible differences in the polarity of attention effects as a
function of individual differences in the morphology of C1 and P1 component were monitored. EEG was recorded from
30 scalp sites in 18 right-handed individuals. The task consisted in paying attention and responding to a conjunction
of space and object features. Stimuli were black and white drawings of familiar objects and animals, presented slightly
lateralized in the right or left hemi-field. Independent of task factors, participants were subdivided in two groups, on the
base of their VEP morphology. A group exhibited a prominent N80 at mesial occipital sites, while, in the same latency
range, the other group exhibited a prominent P80. ERP results showed that the amplitude and polarity of spatial and
nonspatial attention effects were affected by VEP morphology. In fact, attention effects always resulted in an increased
positivity for the P80 group (both at C1 and P1 level), while shape relevance was associated with an enhanced N80 and
P1 responses in the N80 group. RTs were comparable across the 2 groups, thus suggesting an independence of morphology
from task related factors. These data provide evidence of an inversion of attention effects, besides inversion of C1 polarity,
in people exhibiting a negative C1 at mesial occipital sites.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10058" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN ONE BRAIN: AN ERP STUDY ON SIMULTANEOUS INTERPRETERS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Adorni</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l168">

(the so called &#x0201c;word superiority effect&#x0201d;) was modulated by language age of acquisition and proficiency. Words were discriminated
from pseudo-words as early as 150 ms with larger N1 responses to words over the left inferior posterior occipital
area, possibly indexing the activity of the so-called VWFA, only in the native language (L1). At later processing
stages (since 250 ms), corresponding to deeper linguistic processing, we observed a clear difference in the brain response
to languages mastered with a different degree of proficiency (namely English vs. German), both at posterior (N2 and N3
component) and anterior (LPN component) electrode sites areas. These data show how ERPs can dissociate age of acquisition
from proficiency, and be predictive of a person linguistic competence.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10109" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE INFLUENCE OF IMMEDIATE FEEDBACK ON ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING IN CHILDREN: COMBINING

either to a group receiving corrective feedback after retrieval or to a group receiving no feedback. In the behavioural study
children underwent additional testing assessing intelligence, memory capacity, self-concept and other psychological variables.</p><p>Preliminary data of the fMRI study with 12 children receiving corrective feedback indicate that trials following negative
feedback elicited stronger encoding-related activity in occipital regions as compared to trials following positive
feedback. Retrieval eliciting positive as compared to negative feedback was associated with stronger activity in occipital
brain regions and the caudate nucleus while negative feedback as compared to positive feedback increased neural activity
in the anterior cingulate and inferior operculum. These results in children are consistent with prior evidence in adults
that suggest that the anterior cingulate cortex responds to negative feedback while the ventral striatum shows increased
activity with positive feedback. Further, the increased neural activity in occipital brain regions after trials with negative
feedback might reflect heightened attention to the following object-name association in order to improve performance.
First exploratory analysis of the behavioural data (<italic>N</italic>=131) revealed no significant differences in error rates between the two feedback groups. Overall, a positive self-concept concerning physical attractiveness and school achievement in
German language (but not in mathematics) correlated positively with success in task performance.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study is sponsored by a grant from the BMBF (GJ 01 0683 06).</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10198" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EVALUATING PEOPLE: ROLE OF AMYGDALA, STRIATUM, AND PREFRONTAL CORTEX</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l172">

Specifically, the process of impression formation has been isolated primarily to the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), but
it is still unknown what particular mechanisms underlie this. To address this question, we tested which brain regions
were employed while human subjects used different types of information to form impressions of other people.
We were particularly interested in whether impression formation might also recruit areas implicated in emotional
learning and value encoding. During fMRI scanning, subjects were presented with novel target persons.
In each presentation, a face was displayed while 3 negative and 3 positive person-descriptive sentences were introduced
successively. Following these, subjects were instructed to form an impression of targets by indicating their
evaluation using an 8-point valence scale. These responses were used to determine which information was impression-relevant
(for (for example negative sentences for a negativelye-valuated target) and impression-irrelevant (for example
positive sentences for a negatively-evaluated target). We then looked for brain areas that distinguished impression-relevant
from impression-irrelevant information. Extending prior research, we found that the dorsomedial PFC was
engaged during the presentation of social information but did not respond as a function of impression relevance. Interestingly,
the amygdala, striatum and ventromedial PFC showed such dissociation, exhibiting stronger responding to
impression-relevant information. While the amygdala has long been associated with the learning of aversive outcomes
and the striatum largely implicated in reward learning, our results suggest that these and PFC areas work in tandem
to ascribe subjective value to relevant social information. This integrated neural activity may provide a manner
by which impressions are adaptively formed in a social context.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10276" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CEREBRAL CORTEX GREY MATTER CHANGES IN PATIENTS WITH FOCAL CEREBELLAR LESION:

Consistently,
several functional imaging studies in healthy subjects demonstrate direct involvement of the cerebellum in different
cognitive tasks. However, interactions between the cerebellum and cerebral areas still remains largely debated. Aim
of this study was to assess, using MRI and voxel based morphometry (VBM), whether chronic focal cerebellar lesion
may result in regional changes of specific cortical areas. Eighteen patients with a stabilized cerebellar lesion (11 on the
right and 7 on the left side) and 18 sex and age matched healthy controls were recruited. All subjects underwent an
extensive neuropsychological assessment and an MRI study. T2-weighted scans and T1-weighted volumes were collected
from each subject. With the exception of the cerebellar damage, none of the patients had any additional macroscopic abnormality
on T2- weighted scans. After masking the cerebellar lesions, T1-volumes were post-processed according to an
optimized VBM protocol using SPM2. Gray matter (GM) maps were produced for each subject and group comparisons
were performed, on a voxel-by-voxel basis, to assess regional differences in GM density between patients and controls.
Compared with controls, patients with right cerebellar damage showed a bilateral pattern of reduced GM density,
mainly involving the left frontal and temporal lobe. Present study indicates that specific GM abnormalities of the cerebral
cortex may be detected in patients with focal cerebellar damage. These results must be analyzed in light of the known
anatomical organization of the cerebro-cerebellar loops as well as referring to the pattern of the cognitive impairments
observed after focal cerebellar lesions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10364" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PATTERNS OF EXECUTIVE DISORDER IN OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Demeter</surname><given-names>G.

However, the results are contradictory as many studies have found less impaired or intact performance on traditional executive
neuropsychological tasks by OCD patients. The aim of this study was to find specific patterns of impairment in
the executive system in a properly diagnosed clinical sample of OCD patients. To fulfil this aim we used a recent
psychometric model proposed by Miyake, et al. (2000) as a theoretical framework which states that traditional executive

executive functions: inhibition, modality specific updating and shifting-monitoring, and traditional neuropsychological
tasks differently tapping these functions. We applied four widely used neuropsychological tasks: Corsi blocks tapping
task, digit span forward task, the Stroop task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST), as they thought to be

DSM-IV criteria and matched healthy control subjects were involved. The OCD group performed significantly worst in
all of the executive tasks. In a second set of analysis OCD patients were categorized on the basis of their symptoms and
labelled these subgroups as obsessive, compulsive and mixed. The results show that comparing to healthy controls only the
so called compulsive subgroup performed significantly lower on the Stroop Task and produced significantly more preservative
errors on the WCST. In our view this result show that compulsive subgroup is the only one produced impaired performance
on tasks of inhibition and shifting components of the executive system, while the updating component is injured

levels are associated with deteriorated cognitive performance. As GH secretion decreases with age, this may contribute
to cognitive changes associated with ageing. We evaluated the relation between GH secretion and cognition in
older men. We focused on correlations between GH secretion and performance on cognitive tests. Furthermore, we
recorded cortical brain activity using event-related potentials (ERPs) in order to assess underlying neurophysiological
mechanisms. Subjects and Methods: We studied 17 healthy male subjects (age 50&#x02013;78 years). Cognitive function was assessed by standardized neuropsychological tests, in particular specific tests either sensitive or insensitive to ageing.
ERPs were recorded during a go/ no go selective attention task. GH secretion was assessed by a GHRH-GHRP-6 test
and by measurement of plasma IGF-I. Results: GH peak and GH area under the curve (AUC) were significantly correlated
with the number of targets detected in the selective attention task. Speed of responding (mean reaction time)
correlated with IGF-1, with GH peak, and with GH AUC. GH peak significantly correlated with the performance on
the Trailmaking task A. Furthermore, the Number-digit span item scores correlated significantly with the GH AUC. No
correlation was observed between GH secretion and ERP data, in particular N2b, which reflects attention related cortical
activity. Conclusion: Cognitive performance in elderly men, as far as it concerns target detection, speed of responding,
short-term memory, working memory, attention, processing speed, and planning behavior, is associated with
GH secretion. GH secretion was not significantly associated with attention-related brain potentials, which we previously
found to be compromised in childhood onset GH deficient patients</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10520" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>LEXICAL LEARNING: DISSIMILAR ROLES OF CONSONANTS AND VOWELS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vinnik</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l185">

<bold>Background</bold>: A decline in mental speed and memory function has been reported in diabetes, and there is concern that this might be caused by frequent hypoglycemic events (with relation to intensive glucose control), and/or to bad glucose control.</p><p>
<bold>Aims</bold>: To understand how cognitive defects are caused by type 1 diabetes and how they might be prevented. Methods. Patients with type 1 diabetes (<italic>n</italic> = 150) were studied with EEG, auditive evoked potentials in odd-ball paradigms, cognitive tests, neurography and sensory tests. Normal data of the neurophysiological parameters were obtained from 116 healthy controls (age and gender matched). Data were zscored in order to compensate for age and gender effects.
Mean age of patients and controls was 43 years.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: The most significant neurophysiological abnormality was a widespread decline in the auditory evoked potential (N1) with nadirs (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10 &#x02212; 4) in the temporo-parietal regions. Test for correlation between the cognitive scores and the N1 component showed the highest correlation (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10 &#x02212; 4) for the psychomotor speed. Of the relevant clinical variables old age, long diabetes duration and high BMI were the strongest predictors of cognitive decline, whereas frequency of hypoglycemic events had no effect. A pronounced decline of EEG beta power was found in both temporo-occipital regions (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), which was the most significant abnormality in the resting EEG power spectrum. This agrees with two previous studies from our group. However, this abnormality had only weak correlation with the outcome in the cognitive tests.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion</bold>: The present data indicate that age and time dependent factors are important for the cognitive decline in type 1 diabetes. The N1 component of the auditory eventrelated potential is a sensitive test for brain dysfunction in
type 1 diabetes, and its applicability to other disease conditions with cognitive impairment deserves to be evaluated.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by JDRF (Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Intl.).</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10703" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>&#x0201c;OFF-LINE&#x0201d; PREFRONTAL REPETITIVE TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION EFFECTS ON REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD FLOW CHANGES: TIMECOURSE AND SPATIAL EXTENT</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Eisenegger</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l189">

However, the effect on remote interconnected areas and, in particular, the duration of the induced neurophysiological

symptoms. Moreover, some authors found that cognitive performance, in particular, executive dysfunctions, have
predictive value for the further course of depression. However, very few longitudinal studies exist on possible associations
between cognitive function and depression. The objective of this study was to examine cognitive performance in
depressed patients in the acute phase, after remission, and six months after remission, to determine the specificity of cognitive
(dys-)functions and the relevance for the further course of depression. Assessment of cognitive function and psychopathological
symptoms were carried out in 62 depressed inpatients on admission and prior to discharge. Twenty-three
patients were retested six months after discharge. To control for practice effects, 13 healthy subjects were assessed twice
with the same cognitive tests. In the acute stage of depression, patients were impaired in memory, attention, and executive
functions. After remission, cognitive performance was improved, but still impaired in a high number of patients.
As the controls also improved in some tests, improvements in the patient group in these tests may rather reflect practice
and not treatment effects. We found no differences in cognitive performance between remitters and non-remitters, and
severity of depression was not correlated with cognitive performance, indicating that psychopathological and neuropsychological
symptoms are dissociable. In addition, no cognitive function could be ascertained as a predictor for remission
or relapse. Our results support the hypothesis that cognitive impairments are not clear-cut, are trait-dependent,
and are therefore not merely an epiphenomenon of depression. For clinical implications, it is thus important to consider
rehabilitation of cognition as complementary to pharmaceutical and other treatment measures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10802" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>HOW DO WE LEARN TO NAVIGATE: COMPETITION OR COEXISTENCE OF NAVIGATION STRATEGIES?</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Igloi</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zaoui</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Berthoz</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rondi-Reig</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>CNRS UMR 7152- LPPA Collge de France, France</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Navigation in a complex environment can rely on the use of different spatial strategies. However, traditional questions on temporal arousal and hierarchy between strategies are still debated. To address this issue we investigated spontaneous choice and switches between two spatial strategies: the mapbased or allocentric and the route-based or sequential egocentric strategies during the process of navigation. Hitherto we developed the virtual version of the Starmaze, adapted

At present few attention has focus on the numerical
abilities in lower vertebrates. We investigated the ability to discriminate among different numerosities in a poeciliid
fish, Gambusia holbrooki, by using the spontaneous social choice for shoals differing in numerosity in two different
ecological contests: when placed in a potentially dangerous environment and when facing a harassing male. In
both context, we found that females were able to discriminate between two shoals that differed by one element when
the paired numbers were 1 vs 2, 2 vs 3 and 3 vs 4, but not 4 vs 5 or larger. Using large numerosities (&#x0003e;4), in agreement with
the numerical distance effect, the ability to discriminate between two numbers improved as the distance between them
increased, and a significant discrimination was found with ratios of 1 : 2 or smaller (4 vs 8, 8 vs 16 and 4 vs 10). Control
experiments of non-numerical variables evidenced the role played by the total area occupied by the stimuli in the
selection of the larger group. The importance of total movements of the stimuli is less clear, since it may affect quantity
discrimination only in comparisons between large numerosities. In summary our study indicates that spontaneous numerical
abilities in fish are comparable with those of other non-verbal creatures studied; results are in agreement with
the hypothesis of the existence of two distinct systems for quantity discrimination in Vertebrates.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e10966" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TIME COURSE OF SCENE PROCESSING IN HUMANS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Thinus-Blanc</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l191">

(for example, Epstein &#x00026; Kanwisher, 1998; Maguire, Frith, &#x00026; Cipolotti, 2001), the time course of activation of these
structures is relatively unexplored. A fine-grained spatiotemporal analysis would provide information about the dynamics
of the brain network involved in such complex processing. In the present study, intra-cerebral activity was
recorded in epileptic patients while they performed a series of tests of encoding/recognition of visual scenes and of
other types of visual stimuli (objects, faces, abstract structures and configurations,. . .). Thus, it was possible to combine
both high temporal and spatial resolution of the signal. Preliminary results suggest that information related to
&#x0201c;natural&#x0201d; scenes flows from the primary visual cortex (with a latency of about 110 ms) to the posterior parahipoccampal
area (PPA), and later to the posterior and anterior hippocampus. No marked difference of activity was found between
encoding and recognition. Abstract structures did not involve as strongly the parahippocampal cortex. Finally, visual
object processing activated a network where the rhinal cortices were predominantly involved. Further analyses are
currently conducted in order to determine to what extent this apparently serial processing would take place in parallel. The
present data confirm the function of the PPA in scene encoding and recognition as evidenced by fMRI studies, and bring
additional information as to the time course of scene processing and to its functional significance.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11060" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>Theme D: Disorders of the nervous system <break/> MEMORY IMPAIRMENTS IN HEPATIC

Our objective is to evaluate spatial
reference and working memory in different rat models of hepatic dysfunction. Spatial memory, assessed with Morris
water maze, is studied in 90 Wistar rats that are divided in five groups: rats with portocaval anastomosis (PCA), rats
with triple partial portal vein ligation (TPVL), rats that received thioacetamide in the drinking water (0.03%) (TAA),
rats pseudo-operated (PSO) and control rats (CTRL). These five groups are then distributed for the different experiments:
spatial reference memory, PCA (<italic>n</italic> = 8), TPVL (<italic>n</italic> = 10), TAA (<italic>n</italic> = 10), PSO (<italic>n</italic> = 8) and CTRL (<italic>n</italic> = 10), and spatial working memory, PCA (<italic>n</italic> = 8), TPVL (<italic>n</italic> = 8), TAA (<italic>n</italic> = 10), PSO (<italic>n</italic> = 9) and CTRL (<italic>n</italic> = 9). There are not differences between groups in anxiety and activity tasks.The spatial reference memory task shows no differences between groups in escape latencies (F4/41 = 1.469, <italic>p</italic> = 0.229). No-platform probe tests show that CTRL and PSO groups have learned the location of platform since the firts and second days. TAA group is unable to learn the task. PCA rats displays learning only on day 5. TPVL group acquires the task on day 3 but fails on 5. For the spatial working memory task, the groups TPVL and TAA are incapable to acquire the task with no differences between sample and retention trials (<italic>p</italic> = 0.342 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.382). Cirrhosis induced by TAA produces spatial reference and working memory impairment, TPVL produces impairment in working memory and difficulties with reference memory. PCA is able to acquire working memory task
but shows delay with reference. Therefore, models of hepatic dysfunction show different memory impairment and TAA
model seems to be the most serious one.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work was supported by grant MEC SEJ2004-07445, Spain.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11192" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>AN INVESTIGATION OF MOTIVATIONAL PROCESSES IN AN ANIMAL MODEL OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lelos</surname><given-names>M.

Amyloid has been shown to accumulate in a variety of brain regions implicated in memory, including the hippocampal formation. Consistent with the view that <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-amyloid production impairs neuronal mechanisms underlying memory, mice expressing human amyloid precursor protein mutations linked to a familial form of AD (e.g., Tg2576 mice) show deficits in several hippocampus-dependent spatial memory tasks. However, there is less information concerning the effects of this mutation on cognitive processes supported by other neural systems that also display amyloid pathology. In the present study we examined the effects of the APPswe mutation on appetitive learning processes associated with basolateral amygdala, a region that shows age-dependent deposition of <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-amyloid. More specifically, we examined the effects of the APPswe mutation on appetitive incentive learning processes using both instrumental and Pavlovian outcome-specific devaluation tasks. Our results indicated that the APPswe mutation did not affect the animals' ability to form a representation of an action-outcome association or to change their instrumental behaviour following incentive learning. We did, however, find a deficit in the animals' ability to use context cues to access information about the current incentive value of an outcome. These findings have implications for our understanding of the effects of the mutation on the neural systems supporting learning and memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11224" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SPATIAL MEMORY IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LPA1 RECEPTOR NULL MUTATION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>L&#x000f3;pez-Barroso</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l195">

Few experiments have shown a LPA1 receptor involvement in the normal function of the adult hippocampus but no direct evidence has been shown about the LPA1 receptor in learning and memory. In this study, we used a variant of formerly characterized LPA1-
null mutant, that spontaneously arose during colony expansion (maLPA1-null). Spatial learning and memory was studied
in the maLPA1-null mice using the Morris Water Maze (MWM). In addition, it was assessed the exploratory and
locomotor behaviors in the open field and several neurologic functions. maLPA1-null mice showed an impairment
in several neurologic tests: somesthesis, grasping reflex, equilibrium and olfaction tests. Also, a general locomotor impairment
was demonstrated in the open field and MWM tasks, revealed by the reduced velocity in both tasks. Thus,
maLPA1-null mice exhibited an exploratory impairment in the open field, with a reduced general exploration of the open
field. In the MWM, it was observed that the maLPA1-null mice were able to learn a spatial memory task with reference
memory demands. However, the transfer task analysis showed that the maLPA1-null mice spent less time in the target
quadrant in the MWM, suggesting an alteration in the extinction. Complementary, maLPA1-null mice mainly used
non-spatial searching strategies in this task than the wild type mice, that used mainly spatial strategies. The results suggest
the LPA1 receptor involvement in several cortical and hippocampal functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11345" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EXOGENOUS NGF PREVENTS AGE-ASSOCIATED CHOLINERGIC NEURONS ATROPHY BUT HAS LIMITED

In rats, object discrimination depends on the integrity of the cholinergic system, thus it could be expected that nerve growth factor (NGF) can improve the behavior
in aged subjects. The interactive effect of age and cholinergic improvement was assessed behaviorally in young and
aged rats injected intraventriculary with NGF. In order to check an effect of NGF infusion on different type of memory
we examined rats performance in three different behavioral tests: short-lasting training in object-recognition task
(recognition memory) in object-location task (spatial memory), and long-lasting training in acquisition and reversal of
brightness discrimination test (long-term procedural memory). In aged rats, NGF positively effected cognitive processes
related to spatial memory, but was ineffective on memory processes involved in the formation of associations established
in recognition memory tasks. In acquisition of discrimination learning the choice accuracy was the same for
young and aged, both control and NGF-treated rats. However, in reversal learning NGF-treated aged rats mastered the
test much longer and made significantly more errors than all other groups. These indicate that in aged animals exogenous
NGF deteriorates storage and recall of memory. Together, the contrasting findings show that NGF administration modulates
spatial, recognition and visual memory in different not always beneficial ways.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11387" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PLACE-FIELD DYNAMICS OF HIPPOCAMPAL CA1 NEURONS DURING TRAVERSAL OF SPIRAL PATHS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nitz</surname><given-names>D.

CA1 hippocampal neurons. Here, it was determined whether the same behavioral context could drive similar activity patterns
in CA1 hippocampal neurons despite differences in allocentric position. To this end, three rats were trained
to traverse, from outside to inside, leftward-moving and rightward-moving spiral paths. Each spiral path was defined
by 5 cm. walls permitting visualization of distal cues and was comprised of 5 full &#x0201c;loops&#x0201d; leading to a food reward
site in the center. Under these conditions, three features of the spatial firing patterns of CA1 principal neurons were remarkable.
First, CA1 neurons exhibited analogous spatial firing patterns across individual loops of the full spiral track.
Specifically, many neurons (66%) exhibited multiple, robust firing fields approximately localized to the same positions of
3 or more individual loops. Second, for such neurons, firing fields adapted to the size of individual loops. Spatial firing
fields on outer, longer loops were proportionally larger in length than those for inner, shorter loops. Finally, relative
to a radial line drawn through each loop of a given spiral, the centers of mass of firing fields progressively shifted forward.
The former results indicate that hippocampal activity can generalize across similar experiences irrespective of differences
in their duration and relation to allocentric space. The latter result suggests that distance and directional components
of path integration exert dissociable influences on CA1 neurons.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11404" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NMDA RECEPTOR SUBUNIT 1 HYPOMORPHIC MICE SHOW IMPAIRED HIPPOCAMPAL LTP,

genetic model of human AD harbors two transgenes (encoding APP<sub>Swe</sub>, and tau<sub>P301L</sub>) in a homozygous PS1<sub>M146V</sub> knockin background [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. These 3&#x000d7;Tg-AD mice progressively develop A<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> and tau pathology, with a temporal-and regionspecific profile that closely mimics the neuropathology of human AD. Here, male and female mutant and wild-type (129/C57BL6 hybrids) mice were housed at adulthood (3 months of age) with either a running or locked wheel and left in the corresponding housing conditions for the entire experimental period. At 7 months of age, that is at the early stages of AD pathology, mice were tested for anxiety, attentional gating and spatial memory. The 3&#x000d7;Tg-AD mice showed normal anxiety levels, but enhanced acoustic startle reactivity in comparison to controls. Abnormal startle response was observed in mice of both sexes and it was not attenuated by running activity. The 3&#x000d7;Tg-AD mice showed a mild deficit

compounds and it has been included as part of the &#x0201c;core battery&#x0201d; assessment of vital organ functions in the ICH S7A
safety pharmacology guideline. A behavioral test was first introduced by Irwin as a rapid psychotropic screening procedure
adapted for use in mice. Following modifications Functional Observational Batteries (FOBs) were developed for
rats and more recently adapted for use in the most common non-rodent species. It is of particular importance when assessing
neurobehaviour to carefully control and to standardise all factors involved in the test (the animal, the observer,
the observation battery and environmental conditions) to make the data collected objective, reproducible, reliable and
predictive of safety liabilities. In our research's experience, detailed neurobehavioural observation batteries were developed
for use in pre-clinical species: rodents, dogs, mini-pigs and nonhuman primates. The rodent FOB assesses home
cage and open field activities, stimulus reactivity and neuromuscular functions. The dog and mini-pig FOBs have been
developed from rodent one and are, the first focused on the interaction with humans and emphasises evaluation of gait,
postural reactions and reflex functions, while in the second battery, due to the remissive behaviour ofmini-pigs, the evaluations
with handling are limited to a minimum. The monkey FOB is considered to be the most suitable assessment
when effects on higherlevel cognitive and behavioural processes are expected with a direct relevance for humans. In
conclusion, it is possible to perform a reliable neurobehavioual assessment in all the major pre-clinical species, using
a standard observation battery, but the procedure has to be carefully adapted and optimised to the species taking into account
social variables, ethical issues and costs-benefits ratio.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11708" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MOTOR ACTIVITY IS MODULATED VIA DIFFERENT NEURONAL CIRCUITS IN RATS WITH CHRONIC LIVER

remain unclear. It has been suggested that liver disease
alters the neuronal circuits between basal ganglia and cortex

metabotropic glutamate receptors in nucleus accumbens by
injecting DHPG activates one circuit that induces locomotion.
We analyzed by in vivo brain microdialysis the function
of the circuits that modulate motor function in rats with liver
failure due to portacaval shunt (PCS). We inserted cannulae
in nucleus accumbens and microdialysis probes in nucleus
accumbens, ventral pallidum, substantia nigra pars reticulata,
medio-dorsal thalamus, ventro-medial thalamus or prefrontal
cortex. We injected DHPG in nucleus accumbens
and analyzed extracellular neurotransmitters concentration
in these areas. The results indicate that in control rats DHPG
induces locomotion by activating the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; neuronal circuit:
nucleus accumbens &#x0003c; ventral pallidum &#x0003c; medio-dorsal
thalamus &#x0003c; prefrontal cortex. In PCS rats this circuit is not

dopamine in NAcc of control but not of PCS rats and

in dopamine would activate the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; neuronal

milder pervasive developmental disorders are more common in epileptic children than in the general population. Recently a new rodent model of autism induced by prenatal exposure to valproic acid on 12.5 day of gestation has been created (VPA rats). The model has striking etiological, anatomical, and behavioral similarities to human data. VPA rats' susceptibility to seizures has not been studied yet. The purpose of the present experiments was to evaluate male Wistar VPA rats' susceptibility to seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole (PTZ) or audiogenic stimulation. To elicit audiogenic seizures, rats were placed in a Plexiglas cylindrical chamber within soundproof cabinet and exposed to 110 dB sound lasting up to 90 sec, once daily for 14 days. Rats were scored for their reactions according to the widely used Jobe's scale. Another group of rats was observed for 30 min after PTZ (65 mg/kg) intraperitoneal injection. The reaction phases included: unresponsiveness, mild contractions, clonic seizures (with and without loss of righting reflex), and tonic seizures. Both latency to and number of animals
achieving any particular phase were scored. There was no difference between VPA and control animals in severity and
time parameters of audiogenic seizures. There was also no difference in a first-trial (i.e., non-priming induced) audiogenic
seizure. However, VPA rats showed significantly shorter latency to the mild contractions and clonic PTZ-induced
seizures, as well as a higher number of animals expressing clonic seizures.Our data suggest that VPA rats might bemore
susceptible to PTZ-induced seizures. This observation corresponds to the increased frequency of epilepsy in autism
and suggests that prenatal exposure to substances enhancing GABA-ergic tone (e.g., VPA) might increase sensitivity
to epileptogenic substances in subsequent developmental stages.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This research was supported by statutory funds from the State Committee for Scientific Research, Warsaw, Poland.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11772" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INFLUENCE OF SOME PHARMACOLOGICAL DRUGS ON THE HIPPOCAMPAL EPILEPTIFORM DISCHARGES</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Saralidze</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l204">

piracetam and diazepam administration were investigated
in the albino rat. The rats were stereotaxically
implanted with hippocampal electrodes in order to record
epileptic activity. EEG recording was made in the hippocampus
as well as in the neocortex. Epileptiform discharges (ED)
were induced by electrical stimulation of dorsal hippocampus.
To this end study was made of: the effect of piracetam
intraperitoneal injection on hippocampal epileptiform
discharges and the effect of diazepam intraperitoneal injection
on hippocampal epileptiform discharges. Analysis of the
data obtained may lend support to the following conclusions:
Experiments have shown that intraperitoneal administration
of piracetam (20&#x02013;25 mg/kg) decreased epileptogenic
threshold in the hippocampus, whereas diazepam injection
(0.5&#x02013;1 mg/kg) increased epileptogenic threshold. These results
might be because piracetam activates cortical neurons,
which in turn decrease their tonic inhibitory influence on the
hippocampus. Contrariwise, diazepam elevated influences of
the collateral inhibition within the hippocampus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11822" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TOWARDS A MODEL OF NEUROLEPTIC-RESISTANT COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENTS IN SCHIZOPHRENIA:

and cognitive, which exhibit different sensitivity to drugs.
Muscarinic antagonists (e.g., scopolamine) produce an &#x0201c;antimuscarinic
syndrome&#x0201d;, characterized by psychosis and cognitive
impairments. We suggest modeling both symptom
classes as contrasting effects of low and high doses of scopolamine
on latent inhibition (LI). LI indexes the capacity to
ignore irrelevant stimuli as reflected in poorer conditioning
to a stimulus that had been repeatedly preexposed without
consequences. Amphetamine-induced disrupted LI and
its reversal by typical and atypical neuroleptics is a well established
model of positive symptoms. Conversely, abnormally
persistent LI produced by NMDA receptor antagonists
and its reversal by glycinergic drugs and atypical but
not typical neuroleptics has been proposed to model negative/cognitive symptoms. Recently, we reported that low but
not high doses of scopolamine led to LI disruption, which
was reversed by typical and atypical neuroleptics and the
acetylcholinesterase inhibitor physostigmine. Here, we tested
the capacity of a higher dose of scopolamine to produce persistent
LI, and the sensitivity of the latter to neuroleptics and
cognitive enhancers. We found that a high dose of scopolamine
produced abnormal persistent LI, which was resistant
to both typical and atypical neuroleptics (haloperidol and
clozapine), but was reversed by cholinergic and glycinergic
cognitive enhancers (physostigmine and glycine). This contrasts
with LI disruption induced by low scopolamine doses,
which is reversed by both neuroleptics and physostigmine,
and which we have proposed to model the positive spectrum
of antimuscarinic psychosis. As cognitive impairments
in schizophrenia are not improved, or even exacerbated, by
neuroleptics, but can be alleviated by cognitive enhancers,
we suggest that scopolamine-induced abnormally persistent
LI can model neuroleptic-resistant cognitive impairments in
schizophrenia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e11845" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEURO DEVELOPMENT AND BEHAVIORAL CHARACTERIZATION OF EHMT1 MOUSE PUPS WITH

neuropsychiatric-like behavioural alterations (i.e., anxiety,
reduced exploratory behaviour) from early stages when overt
BA and tau neuropathologies are not yet observed, but
when intraneuronal accumulation of Abeta, synaptic and
cholinergic deficits have already been described. More recently,
emerging evidence indicates that intraneuronal Abeta

events and strongly suggest that it is an early, pathological
biomarker for the onset of Alzheimer's disease and associated
cognitive and other behavioral deficits. On the other
hand, postnatal handling (PH, tactile stimulation administered
from postnatal days 1 to 21) is an early-life treatment
known to produce profound and long-lasting behavioural
and neurobiological effects. Emotionality, reactivity to stressors
and exploratory behaviour as well as the functionality
of several neurotransmitter systems can be enduringly altered
by this procedure. The present study was aimed at describing
the effects of early postnatal handling on the behavioural
profile of male and female 3xTgAD mice at early
stages of the disease (4 month-old). The results show that
early postnatal handling treatment increased the activity
levels in the open-field, reduced anxiety in this and other
tests (elevated plus-maze and dark-light box) and improved
the acquisition of place learning in the Morris water maze.
Moreover, impulsive/disinhibitory behaviours observed in
the 3xTgAD groups were also reduced by this treatment.
Therefore, the results suggest that early-life treatments such
as postnatal handling may exert a preventive effect on both
cognitive deficits and emotional alterations characteristic of
Alzheimer's disease.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Thanks to Fundaci&#x000f3; Marat&#x000f3; de TV3 <italic>n</italic>&#x000b0; 062930.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12111" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THERAPEUTICAL EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENRICHMENT ON COGNITIVE AND NEUROPSYCHIATRIC-LIKE SYMPTOMS AT ADVANCED STAGES OF ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE IN 3XTGAD MICE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bl&#x000e1;zquez</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l213">

and fusion of glutamatergic synaptic vesicles. However, the
functional consequences of Bsn loss at striatal synapses remains
unclear. Bsn KO mice (BSN) mice lacking the central
region of the presynaptic active zone protein Bsn show intense
epileptic seizures. In experimental models of epilepsy,
striatal medium spiny (MS) neurons appear more susceptible
to the paroxysmal cortical activity compared to fast-spike
(FS) interneurons. Given the modulatory function of FS interneurons
on striatal activity, it could be that the continuous
spreading of epileptic seizures throughout the cortex in
BSN mice might selectively alter the short- and long-termexcitability
of striatal neuron subtypes To investigate this possibility,
we performed in vitro intracellular recordings to compare
the membrane and synaptic properties of MS and FS
neurons. Successively, we examined the morphology of MS
and FS neurons using Golgi and Parvalbumin staining. Then,
we characterized the behavioral phenotype of BSN mice in a
striatal-dependent learning task. We first observed that the
intrinsic membrane properties of the two neuronal subtypes
were similar in BSN and WT mice. Long-term depression
(LTD) and long-term potentiation (LTP) in MS neurons also
developed normally in both genotypes although the amplitude
of LTP was smaller in the mutants. Surprisingly, BNS
mice showed a potentiation of FS neurons absent in WT
mice, more parvalbumin-positive FS neurons, and increased
dendrite branching on MS neurons. Consistent with this apparent
enhancement in striatal function, BSN mice exhibited
higher active avoidance scores. Our results suggest that striatal
neuron subtypes are differently sensitive to continuous
seizures occurring in BSN mutants. In particular, the emergence
of NMDAdependent plasticity in FS could represent
an adaptive mechanism underlying enhanced performance
in the striatal-dependent active avoidance task.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12335" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE INFLUENCE OF SEROTONINERGIC DRUGS ON THYROID STATUS AND TURNOVER OF BIOGENIC

nomenclature introduced by Dahlstr&#x000f6;m and Fuxe in 1964 for the rat brain. After re-examining the anatomy of the
DAergic populations in the macaque monkey brain using tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunohistochemistry, we
performed dopamine transporter (DAT) and DAT/TH immunohistochemistry. Some differences were found between
the monkey and rat DAergic groups. Group A11 holds abundant DAergic neurons along the whole periaqueductal gray;
for this reason we do not consider A11 a diencephalic group, and we call it periaqueductal group. Group A13 (called in
the rat dorsal hypothalamic group) is formed in the monkey by neurons located more laterally, ventrally and rostrally
than in the rat. Because of its wide extension and because it is the only hypothalamic group not bordering the 3rd ventricle,
we call A13 lateral hypothalamic group. In addition, we subdivide it into A13r (reaching rostrally the preoptic region)
and A13dm-dha (for dorsomedial nucleus and dorsal hypothalamic area). TH-positive neurons, not included in
none of the accepted DAergic groups, are found in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the basal telencephalon and the
striatum. DAT expression is intense in the mesencephalic groups A8&#x02013;A10, as reported for the rat and the human. In
the dorsal tier (A8 dorsal, A9 dorsal, A10) DAT expression shows micro-regional heterogeneity, in which neurons with
different levels of DAT are intermingled, including some with no detectable immunoreactivity. DAT also appears outside
the mesencephalon. Some DATpositive neurons appear in the caudal half of A11; thus we subdivide A11 into A11r
(rostral part with no DAT) and A11c. In addition, some slightly DAT-positive neurons are found in the basal telencephalon.
No DAT-positive neuronal somatas appear in the lateral parabrachial nucleus, the hypothalamus or the striatum.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Supported by BFI 2002-00513 and SAF2005-5380.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12394" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IS IT POSSIBLE TO INFLUENCE THE EFFECTS OF A FOREBRAIN CHOLINERGIC DEPLETION?

neurosciences is to identify instruments for contrasting
the cognitive decay inescapably present in patients affected
by Alzheimer Disease (AD). A large body of data indicates
that the cognitive deficits in AD are due to the loss
of cholinergic input from basal forebrain structures to the
cortex and hippocampus. Various animal paradigms have
been developed tomodel these cholinergic dysfunctions and,
at present, the immunotoxin 192 IgG-saporin is considered
one of the most effective methods for selectively destroying
cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. Aim of the
present study was to analyse the influence of environmental
(rearing in enriched environment) and pharmacological
(acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, Donepezil) factors on the effects
of 192 IgG-saporin-induced cholinergic depletion in the
dendritic morphology of III-layer pyramidal neurons of the
rat parietal cortex. The neuronal analysis was performed by
taking into account dendritic branching and spine density.
These indices allow inferring changes in the synapse activity,
given the dendrites receive more than 95% of the synapses
of the neuron. In lesioned animals reared in standard conditions,
the parietal neurons exhibited increased synaptic spine
number and reduced dendritic arborisation. In enriched lesioned
animals, the parietal neurons maintained the higher
level of spine density provoked by the enriched rearing although
they presented a reduced dendritic arborisation. Preliminary
data suggest that in the III-layer parietal neurons the morphological modifications induced by cholinergic depletion
are not significantly influenced by the administration
of an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. These findings indicate
that exogenous factors, as the environmental enrichment, are
able to affect the neuronal modifications related to the cortical
cholinergic depletion and suggest a possible anatomical
background for the &#x0201c;brain reserve&#x0201d; hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12463" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SYSTEMIC BIOCHEMICAL ALTERATIONS IN BRAIN IN SCHIZOPHRENIA</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boksha</surname><given-names>I.

neural development of rodents leading to changes in physiological
and behavioral reactivity to stress. These effects are
likely to be mediated by changes in maternal behaviour. This
study analysed the effects of different manipulations of the
rearing environment on maternal behaviour and the behavioral
and physiological response to mild challenges in CD-1
mouse pups early during development. Litters underwent either
15 min of neonatal handling (H) or were exposed briefly
to an unfamiliar male intruder from postnatal (PND) day 2&#x02013;14 (MI). Both groups were compared with litters which were
not manipulated (NH). Compared to NH subjects, maternal
behaviour in the MI group was increased only on the first
day of introduction of the male intruder, while the H group
showed an increase in maternal behaviour also on PND 10.
As for aggressive behaviour expressed by the MI dams, the
number of attacks towards the male intruder decreased significantly,
while social interactions and non-social activities
increased over subsequent encounters. On PND 8, pups ultrasonic
vocalizations were recorded upon treatment with an
axiolytic drug (chlordiazepoxide 0, 2, or 7.5 mg/kg). Results
indicate that, in the absence of basal changes, compared to
the NH and MI groups, handled subjects did not reduce their
calling rate following drug administration. Following maternal
separation and novelty exposure on PND 9, levels of hippocampal
NGF increased significantly only in the H group.
These data suggest that active pup manipulations in the form
of handling favour behavioral and neural plasticity resulting
in the maintenance of an adequate level of arousal and in increased
neurotrophin levels in response to an acute manipulation.
Changes in hippocampal levels of NGF might be involved
in the appraisal of subtle changes in the early social
environment.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Support by ISS-NIH grant Rif.0F14 to FC and EA.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12560" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EARLY ADVERSITY AFFECTS NERVE GROWTH FACTOR AND BRAIN-DERIVED NEUROTROPHIC

individual vulnerability to psychiatric illness. However, the
quality and quantity of experience predisposing an individual
towards psychopathology and the specific neural substrates
affected are still open questions. Among those factors
involved in brain development and function, neurotrophins
appear as good candidates for mediating long-term effects
of experience on brain function. We have taken a comparative
approach using both rodents and primates (rhesus
macaques) to test the hypothesis that changes in the levels
of neurotrophins (i.e., NGF and BDNF) during critical periods
of brain development might be considered as markers
of neuroplasticity. We have shown that, in rodents, brain
levels of neurotrophins are sensitive to manipulations of the mother-infant relationship. We have recently measured peripheral
levels of NGF and BDNF in rhesus macaques exposed
to early stress (reared in the presence of peers, rather
than by the mother). Results indicate that plasma levels of
neurotrophins are increased by peer rearing, suggesting that
these markers of brain plasticity might also be peripheral
measures of early stress in primates, possibly underlying the
disfunctional social behavior characterizing these subjects.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by ISS-NIH grant Rif. 0F14 to FC and EA.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e12653" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SIMPLE DEVICES FOR MULTIPLE UNIT ACTIVITY RECORDINGS IN FREELY MOVING RATS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>T&#x000f3;th</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l227">

an increased amount of serotonin (5-HT) in the hypothalamus.
A ventricular infusion of an AVP receptor antagonist or
a microinjection of a 5-HT neurotoxin into the anterior hypothalamus
reduced the aggressiveness of Cav2.2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to a
wild-type level, indicating that an enhancement of the 5-HTAVP

These results suggest that N-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels in

and regulating maternal behavior through their cellular receptors,
within behaviorally relevant brain areas. Dopamine
receptor antagonists disrupt ongoing maternal behavior for
example pup-retrieval and nest building. Moreover, variations
in nucleus accumbens dopamine are correlated with
individual differences in maternal behavior. On the other
hand, serotonin system function is increased during lactation
and its activation induces various forms of maternal
behavior. Expression of maternal behavior towards the offspring
is increased following &#x0201c;neonatal handling&#x0201d;. We employed
this experimental paradigm in order to determine the
effect of maternal behavior on the levels of D1 and serotonin
1A (5-HT1A) receptors (by in vitro autoradiographic
ligand binding) in areas of the limbic system (hippocampus
and prefrontal cortex) and in the basal ganglia of lactating
mothers. In the brain of lactating mothers, levels of
D1 receptors were increased in the striatum, nucleus accumbens
and tuberum olfactorius, while levels of 5-HT1A receptors
were decreased in the prefrontal cortex and in the CA1,
CA4 and DG. Moreover, the reduction in 5-HT1A receptors
was more pronounced in the DG of mothers whose pups
were subjected to &#x0201c;handling&#x0201d;. These localized alterations in
D1 and 5-HT1A receptors during lactation support their
role in the regulation of distinct aspects of maternal behavior:
D1 receptors are probably involved in the regulation of
motivational and motor components of maternal behavior
by the basal ganglia, while 5-HT1A receptors in the modulation
of emotional reactions by the limbic system during
the post-partum period. Moreover, alterations in the neurochemistry
of the limbic system could possibly explain the
modifications of maternal behavior following handling of the
pups.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work has been Supported by the Special Account for Research Grants-University of Athens.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13054" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECTS OF AN EARLY LIFE EXPERIENCE ON DOPAMINE AND OPIOID RECEPTORS IN THE RAT BRAIN</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stamatakis</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kiosterakis</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vlassi</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tzanou</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stylianopoulou</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Laboratory of Biology-Biochemistry, University of Athens, Athens, Greece</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Early life events, particularly the mother-infant interactions,
have been recognized as major factors in determining
adult behavior. An animal model altering maternal behavior
is &#x0201c;neonatal handling&#x0201d;, which has been shown to affect
the programming of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis and thus the responsiveness to stressful stimuli. Moreover,
neonatally handled animals are known to exhibit as
adults addictive-like behaviors, for example, increased consumption
of palatable, sweet food and increased initial
preference for cocaine. Since the dopaminergic and opioid
systems have been implicated in the etiopathogenesis
of addictive-like behaviors, we investigated the effects of
&#x0201c;neonatal handling&#x0201d; on the distribution of D1 and D2 receptors
(by in vitro autoradiographic ligand binding) as
well as of mu-opioid receptors (by immunohistochemistry
and in vitro autoradiographic ligand binding) in the cortex,
hippocampus and basal ganglia of adult animals of both
sexes. &#x0201c;Neonatal handling&#x0201d; resulted in increased levels of D1
receptors in the prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens
only of male animals. In the striatum handled males had
higher numbers of D1 receptors compared to the respective
non-handled, while the opposite held true for the females.
On the other hand, D2 receptors were not affected
by &#x0201c;neonatal handling&#x0201d;. Mu-opioid receptors were increased
in the nucleus accumbens and in the CA3 and CA4 hippocampal
areas of handled animals of both sexes, compared

of the mother-infant attachment bond. Mu opioid receptors
have been shown to mediate in the pups the reward inherent
in maternal contact. Based on the above we employed an
experimental model of perturbed mother-pup contact and
determined immunohistochemically the levels of mu-opioid
receptors in the brain of the offspring as neonates as well
as adults. In our model rats were exposed during post-natal
days 10 to 13 to a T-maze containing their mother at the
end of its right arm. Two experimental groups were used:
non frustrated rats which, upon finding the entrance of the
mother-cage, were allowed to enter through a sliding door so
that animals were retrieved by their mother and frustrated
rats which, upon finding the cage, were not allowed to enter,
since the sliding door remained closed, thus inhibiting tactile
contact between the mother and the infant. On P13, two
hours after the last exposure to the T-maze, frustrated rats
had significantly increased numbers of mu-opioid receptor
immunopositive cells in the basolateral and central amygdaloid
nuclei as well as in nucleus accumbens, whereas at
3 months of age frustrated animals showed higher levels of
mu-opioid receptors in nucleus accumbens and in the CA4
hippocampal region, compared to the non-frustrated and

elicited by the inhibition of the mother-pup tactile
contact. Interestingly, this increase is localized in the amygdala,
nucleus accumbens, and the hippocampus, brain areas
known to play a cardinal role in detecting and responding to
motivationally and emotionally significant stimuli. The alterations
induced by the perturbed mother-infant interaction
are long-lasting, extending into the adulthood and possibly

however, showed in several aspects significant differences

of the visible burrow system (VBS), in which mice are continuously
monitored as social hierarchies form and experimental
manipulations are implemented. By utilizing the
combined technologies of implanted micro-transponders on
each mouse and in-cage antennae, individual mice are continually
monitored in real-time. The resultant data are capable
of identifying the dominant mouse by his patrolling behaviour
and chasing of other mice through the tubes. In pilot
groups of 7 mice/group, the dominant male (as identified
by initial observation and external indices such as tail bites)
regularly shows substantially higher activity than all other
mice, and will be the &#x0201c;chaser&#x0201d; in 74% to 94% of chase events.
These chase events are coded as two mice passing through
the same 50 cm long tube in the same direction, in less than
2 seconds (ie running), and the two mice being less than 2
seconds apart in their completion of the event (ie chasing).
These chase events are then broken down into who chases
whom, and when and where they happen. Further to monitoring
such data, we also demonstrate that in groups with
lower stress levels (as measured by weight loss and tail bites),
it appears as though the stress/aggression level can be augmented
by introducing a female mouse into the arena, but
inaccessible through a wire grid. Future potential manipulations
include limiting or presenting food or water access
in different parts of the arena or at different times in order
to apply or reduce stress generally, or to specific animals, or study rank-ordering in resource access. The general aim is to
utilize the automatic recording to develop social scenarios for
study and to identify early indicators of stress and depression
and explore methods of early intervention.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work was supported by a NARSAD Young Investigator Award to Mike Galsworthy, by the Swiss SNF, the NCCR

mouse strains (C57BL/6 and DBA/2) to extrinsic and motivational

opposite depending on task difficulty. We then describe how
mouse behaviour can be formalized and studied using reinforcement

of stress and genetic background on learning and memory
can be attributed to differential dynamics of model metaparameters
(such as learning rate or exploitation-exploration

We hypothesis that in KO mice reduced exposure to reactive oxygen species throughout life may slow down brain ageing, leading to better cognitive performance. Adult (4-months-old) and old (24-months-old) WT and KO mice were assayed for spatial memory in a Morris water maze (MWM). Since emotionality is a modulator of behavioral responses,
adult mice underwent an open field test to assess
emotional reactivity and a tail flick to assay nociception. To
further characterise the KO phenotype basal levels of brainderived
neurotrophic factor (BDNF: a neurotrophin involved
in several aspects of memory retention, mood disorders and
pain sensitivity) were assessed in the hippocampus and cortex
of adult and old mice. KO adult subjects were characterised
by significantly better memory performance in the
MWM, lower emotionality and a higher pain threshold when
compared to WT mice. Moreover, basal levels of BDNF were
significantly higher in the hippocampus of KO adult than in
the WT subjects. Old subjects were unable to learn the MWM
task, although KO mice showed overall a better physical performance.
These results overall show that oxidative stress not
only affects physical aspects of ageing, as seen in old subjects
but, more interestingly, can modulate responses to painful
or arousing stimuli and lead to better cognitive performance
(adult mice) pointing to this gene as a novel target for studying
the mechanisms underlying emotionality.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13623" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEUROCHEMICAL CHANGES IN AMYGDALA AND PIRIFORM CORTEX REVEALED BY MICRODIALYSIS

recordings, we showed that olfactory fear conditioning induces
synaptic changes in the basolateral amygdala (BLA)
and posterior piriform cortex (PPC) suggesting an involvement
of these two structures in the learning. In order to further
characterize the learning-induced modifications in these
sites, the present work was aimed at monitoring the variations
of neurotransmitter concentrations in BLA and PPC
during odor fear acquisition. For that purpose, high temporal
resolution (1-min sampling rate) microdialysis experiments
were carried out on freely-moving Long-Evans rats
receiving either six odor(CS)-shock(US) pairings (Trained
group) or six presentations of odor alone (Control group).
Simultaneous monitoring of GABA and Glutamate was performed
in both PPC and BLA during the conditioning session
in both groups. In trained animals, a transient increase
in Glutamate was observed in BLA for the two first CS-US
pairings as compared to control rats, whereas a significant
increase in GABA levels was shown for the second pairing
only. The most significant variations were observed in PPC:
transient increases in both GABA and Glutamate levels were
found after each odor-shock pairing, the amplitude of enhancement
being greater for GABA (+25&#x02013;50%) than for Glutamate
(+10&#x02013;25%). In addition in trained animals, for both neurotransmitters, the increase observed in BLA occurred
earlier (around 1&#x02013;2 min) than in PPC. The present data are
in agreement with our previous electrophysiological data,
which confirms the involvement of BLA and PPC in odor fear
learning. In addition high temporal resolution microdialysis
allowed us to show a temporal dynamic of activation of these
structures during the course of successive pairings, with the
involvement of BLA during the first odor-shock associations
preceding neurotransmitter release in PPC, after which PPC
alone shows learning-induced modifications.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supportorted by Universit&#x000e9; Lyon 1 &#x00026; CNRS.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13695" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NORADRENERGIC SYSTEM IN THE BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA DURING CONDITIONED ODOR AVERSION

of an odorizedtasteless solution (conditioned stimulus,
CS) previously paired with toxicosis. COA occurs only when
the interstimulus interval (ISI) is kept short, suggesting that
the memory trace of the odor is subject to rapid decay. Previous
experiments have shown that the basolateral amygdala
(BLA), is involved in the processes that control the olfactory
memory trace during acquisition of COA. More precisely,
some recent results have shown that catecholamine
depletion, as well as infusion of propranolol in the BLA impaired
COA. Since <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>- but also <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1-adrenoceptors are present
in the BLA, the present experiment investigated what part
played the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1-adrenoceptors in the effect induced by the catecholamine
depletion on COA. Male Long-Evans rats bilaterally
implanted with cannulae aimed at the BLA were exposed
to odor-toxicosis pairing using a 15 min ISI. Three groups of
rats received infusions of 0.1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g of the selective <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1-antagonist
prazosin either before (pre-CS) or after the CS presentation
(post- CS) during the acquisition, or before the test (pre-test)
of COA. Results showed that neither post-CS or pre-test infusions
of Prazosin impaired COA. In contrast, pre-CS infusion
of Prazosin induced a strong and clear deficit of COA. Since
pre-test group diplayed a COA, the deficit observed in Pre-CS
group was not due to a potential side effect of prazosin on an
attentional, motivational or sensory process. More likely, it
is suggested that pre-CS infusion of prazosin affected a process
related to the to be conditioned olfactory memory trace
duration. Therefore, and in accordance with our previously
reported selective pre-CS effect of propranolol on COA, our
result confirm that the noradrenergic system in the BLA is
involved in the control of the olfactory memory trace during
acquisition of COA, and suggest more precisely that the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1-
adrenoceptors are involved, at least in part, in the mediation
of this effect.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13744" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE SENSITIZATION OF ACOUSTIC STARTLE REFLEX BY FOOTSHOCK IS PROLONGED IN RATS TREATED

(NE)-containing neurons in brain are activated
during stress. We previously reported a decrease in the basal
level of CRH immunoreactivity in the central nucleus of
amygdala and the tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity
in the locus coeruleus after chronic variable stress (CVS)
whereas both response was augmented by a novel stress.
Since the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) can be enhanced
by the CRH neuronal activity in the central nucleus of
amygdala, we examined the influence of footshock on ASR
in rats exposed to CVS. The footshock after CVS caused
a significant augmentation of ASR compared with the
acute footshock. Moreover, The enhanced startle to acute
footshock was maximally increased at 6 min and was absent
after 40 min, whereas the maximal change of the enhanced
startle to footshock after CVS was delayed to 14 min and
the significant enhanced startle was found until 180 min.
The footshock-enhanced startle after CVS may be related
to the augmentation of CRHNE activity, leading to the
possibility that a prolonged CRH hyperactivity to stress
might generate a pathophysiology of the major depression
with a vulnerability to stress.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13791" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>STUDY OF STRESS ON THE HIPPOCAMPUS FORMATION WITH ETHANOL ADMINISTRATION IN

adrenocortical hormone corticosterone (CORT) facilitates
the consolidation of emotional experience. Nevertheless,
high release of CORT, which can occur in extreme stressful
situation, can result in memory deficits. This suggests
that beyond a certain level of stress, the influence of CORT
on memory consolidation may switch from a facilitating effect
to a deleterious effect, leading to maladaptive emotional
responses with regards to the aversive learning experience.
Nevertheless, the boundary conditions under which such a
switch can be observed are still elusive.</p><p>In order to specify these conditions, we used in mice two
fear conditioning procedures known to result in a preferential
conditioned fear response either
<list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>to a discrete tone (i.e., tone-shock pairing: the tone is
predictive of a mild footshock occurrence) or</p></list-item><list-item><p>to contextual cues (i.e., tone-shock unpairing: tone not
predictive).</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>First, we show that increasing the intensity of footshock
from a very low (0.3 mA) to a relatively high (1 mA) level
gradually enhances conditioned fear responses in an adaptive
manner, that is, as a function of the tone-shock contingency.
However, beyond the critical footshock intensity of
1 mA, fear responses become maladaptive, that is, independent
on the conditioning procedure.</p><p>Second, preliminary results indicate that under
mild footshock intensity (0.5 mA), posttraining intrahippocampal
infusions of CORT dose-dependently enhance
adaptive conditioned fear responses. However, beyond
a critical dose maladaptive conditioned fear responses
are again observed. Finally, we also assessed whether the
CORTdependent switch from adaptive to maladaptive fear
responses was associated with changes in ERK1/2 activationrelated
recruitment of the hippocampal-amygdalar circuit.
Altogether, these results throw light on boundary conditions
of CORT-dependent normal and pathological fear
learning.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e13962" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>BEHAVIORAL ABNORMALITIES IN ADA-DEFICIENT MOUSE MODEL</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jofra Hernandez</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l258">

proportion of patients surviving after bone marrow
transplant or enzyme replacement therapy. To test if these
alterations are part of the disease phenotype we performed
a detailed assessment of the learning and behavioral features
in the ADA-deficient mouse model. ADA ko and wt
mice littermates were subjected to the Fox battery test to
assess their sensory and motor developmental abilities as
well as to the RotaRod test to evaluate the motor coordination
and neurological deficits. We found no significant differences
between neither ADA ko nor wt mice nor female
and male in their ability to perform FOX battery and RotaRod
tests. We then investigated emotional, motivational
and exploratory behavior using the open field and lightdark
box test in mice 15 and 20 days old. We found that
ADA ko mice were significantly less active in the open field
as compared to ADA wt mice as assessed by different parameters.
However, the speed of movement was not different
between the groups. Remarkably, the time spent in the
light compartment of the light-dark box was significantly
decreased in ADA ko mice compared to control mice. Together
these results suggest that the ADA ko mice are not
physically unable to move but prefer to remain in safer
zones, probably for anxiety-related reasons. As part of our
future plans we will test the ability of different treatments
(enzyme replacement therapy, bone marrow transplantation
and gene therapy with hematopoietic stem cells) to
rescue the observed phenotypes. These findings will contribute
to improve our knowledge on the pathogenesis of
the ADA-SCID as well as to the design of better therapeutic

The purpose of present stude was investigation of an influence of the intraspecies deprivation on the passive
avoidance response. Behavior of animals were investigated in the rats, were isolated since 14th day (for 8 weeks)
and control animals. In order to elaborate the passive avoidance response, special two-compartment chamber was used.
Experiments were carried out in three stages: I-Exploration, II-Learning, III- Retrieval. Thus has shown that in the postlearning
period (Stage III) the time spent in the dark compartment decreased in both control and isolated animals that
point at acquisition in the animals of the passive avoidance behavior. However the isolated animals when tested 24 hours
after the learning, did not enter at all into the dark compartment unlike the control animals. Formation of the passive
avoidance response depends on the competitive relation between the inner aversive (fear of open, well-lit space) reaction,
on the one hand, and acquired avoidance response on the other. It was shown also that activation of the cholinergic
system promotes acquisition and retrieval processes in the passive avoidance. Meanwhile, in the rats raised in conditions
of the social isolation, a hypersensitivity of the brain acetylcholine-receptors does occur. Therefore, increase of the
latent period of entrance into the dark compartment, found in the isolated rats, the authors explain as improved retention
of the avoidance response in the memory. According to the above-said, we think that in the isolated rats, as compared
to the control ones, dominates the avoidance reaction and deprivation of the social relations improves processes of formation
of the passive avoidance response and its retention in the long-term memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14041" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ANATOMICAL EVIDENCES AND NEUROCHEMICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF A PONTO-SEPTAL PATHWAY

and retrieval. This oscillation appears during REM sleep
and also in the awake animal during information-seeking
behaviours and voluntary movements. The complete circuitry
involved in its generation, maintenance or regulation
remains unclear. Medial septum-diagonal band (MSDB) is
considered the pacemaker of the rhythm. Pontine key structures
activate (reticularis pontis oralis, RPO) or desynchronize
the oscillation (median raphe, MR). The supramammillary
nucleus (SuM) modulate theta frequency. Since the efferences
of the nucleus incertus (NI) include MSDB, MR, SuM
and HPC, this tegmental nucleus-belonging to the arousal
system-could be part of theta circuitry. Recently we have
verified in urethane-anaesthetized rats that NI neurons increased
their activity under theta predominance induced by
RPO stimulation or sensory stimuli. Moreover, NI stimulation
elicited theta and NI lesion or inhibition abolished the
synchronization induced by RPO. Our electrophysiological
data suggested a pathway RPO-NI-MSDB. In order to verify
this pathway, simultaneous injection of anterograde tracer
in RPO and retrograde tracer in MSDB were performed, revealing
double labelled neurons in NI. Subsequent inmunochemical
detection of choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), parvalbumin
(PV), calbindin (CB), calretinin (CR), orexin (OX)
and glutamate vesicular transporter 2 (VGLUT2) was performed.
The preliminary results of this study support the
ideas that NI has to be considered as part of the subcortical
theta rhythm circuitry and that its effect over theta is mediated
at least by GABAergic transmission, with orexinergic
influence. A possible circuit is proposed on the basis of the
anatomical, neurochemical and electrophysiological data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14124" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MODULATION OF ADULT BEHAVIOR AND BASAL CORTICOSTERONE SECRETION BY NEONATAL

affect adult brain functions concerning emotionality, stress
response and synaptic plasticity. We have applied a &#x0201c;novelty
exposure&#x0201d; protocol in rats of both sexes, frompostnatal day 2
to 21, to investigate effects on their exploratory behavior, spatial
memory and HPA axis activity. This protocol differs from
the widely used models of early handling or maternal separation,
in that the only additional stimulus experienced by the
pups is the environment of a novel cage (split litter design).
In adulthood, animals were behaviorally tested in a Y-maze
task and 1 week later they were blood sampled and killed in
basal conditions. The task consisted of a 15 min-acquisition
trial where only 2 arms were accessible and a 5 min-retrieval
trial, 4 h later, where all 3 arms were accessible. In terms
of general locomotion activity and motivation for exploration,
female rats exposed to novelty made more entries in
the accessible Y-maze arms compared to all other groups,
when first exposed to the maze. In the retrieval trial, general locomotion was similar among all groups. Novelty exposure
improved spatial memory and novel arm discrimination in
both sexes, in a sexually dimorphic manner. On one hand,
&#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; males visited the novel arm more often in the beginning
of the second trial, but then splat their entries in known
and start arms as well. On the other hand, &#x0201c;novel&#x0201d; females
started trial 2 with a preference for novel armcombined with
often visits to the known armand ended it with a clear preference
for the novel arm. By the end of the retrieval, all animal
groups progressively lost their interest for exploration, entering
more the start arm. Novelty exposure increased basal
corticosterone levels in adult females, but not males, and did
not affect adrenal weight or histology in either sex.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by grant 70/3/8372 of the Greek General Secretariat of Research &#x00026; Technology.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14203" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SPATIAL LEARNING AND MEMORY ABILITIES ARE PREDICTED BY INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES IN

such as age, environment, behavioral styles, stress, or a
combination of them. This work aims to study whether different
behavioral traits in rodents (frequently stable in time
and, therefore, regarded as a sort of &#x0201c;personality&#x0201d; traits) can
predict performance in spatial learning and memory tasks in
different individuals. Adult male Wistar rats were first characterized
for their anxiety level, reactivity to explore novel
environments and objects, social hierarchy in the homecage,
and locomotor responses to novelty. For this purpose, we
used a variety of behavioral tasks, including the Elevated Plus
Maze, Open field, Novel object reactivity, Open field &#x0201c;emergency&#x0201d;
test, Light and dark test, circular corridor, 16-hole
board, social interaction and water competition tests. Subsequently,
all rats were trained in the hippocampus-dependent
Radial Arm Water Maze (RAWM) task to explore their spatial
learning, long-term memory and reversal learning capabilities.
Our results indicate that both exploration and social hierarchy
are highly related to performance in the spatial learning
and memory tasks. High explorative animals are better
learners in the RAWM task than low explorative ones. Moreover,
and surprisingly, alpha-rats (dominants) are clearly the
worst learners among the three animals living together in the
homecage. These results suggest that certain behavioral styles
or &#x0201c;traits&#x0201d; (such as exploration, frequently related in the rodent
literature to novelty-seeking behavior) and behavioral
states (such as social hierarchy, which to a great extent develops

however, the specific interactions among limbic elements
(i.g., CA1, basolateral amygdala [BLA] and the entorhinal
cortex [EC]) generating affective memory are obscure.
Previously, we investigated ERK1/2 and CREB actvation
pattern in these areas following spatial memory under
different stress conditions. Learning under lower level of
stress was found to involve predominantly CA1 while learning
the same task under higher levels of stress involved also
the BLA. In the present study we examined the pattern of activation
of these areas following spatial memory re-activation
under different levels of stress. Five groups of animals were
tested: &#x0201c;learning&#x0201d; animals were trained either in the cold
(higher stress) or in the warm (lower stress) water; &#x0201c;no platform&#x0201d;
animals were subjected to the maze without a platform
either in cold (higher stress) or in warm (lower stress) water;
&#x0201c;naives&#x0201d; were not exposed to the maze. The &#x0201c;learning&#x0201d; and
&#x0201c;no platform&#x0201d; animals were introduced to a water maze under
cold or warm water for one trial after 24 h, and taken
for biochemical analysis 10 min following the water maze
procedure. In the present study increased ERK1/2 activation
was detected in CA1, BLA and EC in both the learning and
the no platform groups under higher stress conditions only.
Whereas, CREB activation significantly marked a lower stress
condition (i.e., warm water) in all areas examined. The data
suggests diverse molecular pathways involvement in reactivation
of the spatial memory generated under different stress
conditions, thus implying on memory creation of a different
quality under higher versus lower levels of stress. Moreover,
the results further emphasize the role of the limbic system areas
in emotional memory reactivation and indicate that the
ERK1/2 and CREB are activated during memory reconsolidation
in a different pattern than during memory formation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14255" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>CRITICAL ROLE OF THE 65KD ISOFORM OF GLUTAMIC ACID DECARBOXYLASE IN CONSOLIDATION AND

system is critical for fear memory formation. Moverover,
the key enzyme in GABA synthesis, glutamic acid decarboxylase
67 (GAD67) has been identified as a genetic factor in
mood and anxiety disorders. In this study we investigated
in wild type and genetically manipulated mice the role of
a second, activity dependent GAD isozyme, GAD65, in the
consolidation and generalization of conditioned fear. Firstly,
we demonstrate a transient reduction of GAD65 gene expression
in the basolateral amygdala (BLA), 24 h after conditioning.
Secondly, we show that targeted ablation of the GAD65
gene in GAD65&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice results in a pronounced context independent,
intramodal generalization of fear memory during
long-term memory retrieval. The lack of a similar generalization
during short-term memory retrieval and failure
of GAD65&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to enhance the stimulus-specific response
over time suggest a disturbance of fear memory consolidation
processes in the mutant mice. An analysis of neural activity
patterns in freely behaving mutant mice, finally, revealed
a reduction of theta frequency synchronization between
LA and area cornu ammonis (CA1) and deficits in
&#x003b3;-frequency oscillations in the LA of GAD65&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice.
Interestingly, the latter effect was also observed as a result
of overtraining in wild type mice, indicating an involvement
in both genetically dispositioned and experience-dependent
fear. Together our data strongly suggest that GAD65 plays a
key role in the consolidation of stimulus-specific fear memory
and represents a genetic disposition factor for fear memory
generalization.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14320" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECT OF RESTRAINT ON THE EXTINCTION OF INHIBITORY AVOIDANCE IN CD1 MICE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Valls-Rios</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l267">

to the development of anxiety-related disturbances such as
phobias and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Current
neurobiological and psychological studies on the pathophysiology
of PTSD in humans emphasize the importance of disturbed
memory systems, particularly deficits in fear extinction.
Thus, the present study was designed to determine the
effect of acute stress on the extinction of conditioning with
an aversive stimulus. The CD1 male mice were restrained for
2 hours and, 5 days afterwards, were subjected to the training
phase of inhibitory avoidance conditioning. After a 90 second
adaptation period to the apparatus in the light compartment,
the animals received an inescapable footshock of 0.7 mA for
5 seconds when it entered the dark compartment. The test
phase was carried out 24 h after training and when the task
was finished the animals were placed into the black compartment,
but with no shock, to achieve the extinction of conditioning.
This phase was repeated another three times. Both
stressed and controlmice significantly increased the latencies
of crossing in the test phase, showing that the acute stress did
not impair the learning of the task. However, control animals
extinguished the conditioned avoidance on the fourth
test phase, 6 days after the training phase, but the stressed
mice did not. This finding indicates that acute stress, such
as restraint, impairs the extinction of inhibitory avoidance in
male mice. The effect of stress on the extinction of fear memories may
constitute a useful animal model to understand the
underlying mechanisms of the vulnerability to suffering disorders
such as PTSD.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14382" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EXPOSURE TO A STRESSFUL EVENT IMPAIRS EXTINCTION IN TWO AVERSIVE PARADIGMS:

a no-longer relevant conditioned cue is an essential part of
a healthy emotional memory system. Despite the efficacy of
behavior therapy for anxiety disorders, extinction-like treatments
require repeated cue exposures and are vulnerable
to reversal by a number of environmental factors, particularly
stress. The interaction between stressful experiences and
memory has focused mainly on the behavioral and neural
mechanisms of memory consolidation, but not on memory
extinction. Here we show that exposure to a mild stressor
(i.e., placing animals on the elevated platform for 30 min)
had a long-term effect of impairing the extinction of contextual
fear conditioning and conditioned taste aversion. We
further show that microinfusing RU-486, a glucocorticoid
receptors (GRs) antagonist, into the basolateral amygdala
(BLA) reversed the impairing effects of the stressor in the
fear paradigm, but not in the aversion paradigm. Hence, the
results suggest that although in both paradigms the stressor
increased resistance to extinction, there is a differential involvement
of the GRs in the BLA in the fear versus the taste
aversion paradigm. The inhibition of fear via extinction receives
increasing attention, since it could become an effective
intervention for the treatment of fear related disorders. We
present first evidence, as far as we know, for the deleterious
effects a stressful experience might have on extinction. The
effect of stressful experiences is important as it may predispose
some individuals to the development of anxiety disorders
such as posttraumatic stress disorder or exacerbate its
symptomatology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14421" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PATTERNS OF VISUAL SCANNING SHOW GREATER ATTENTION TOWARD THE RIGHT HEMIFIELD THAT IS

more intensely by the left than the right hemiface.
Though studies have indicated a left visual field (right hemiface)
bias in healthy adults (HA) while viewing neutral faces,
there has been little examination of such patterns in response
to emotional faces and most designs have lacked a non-facial
control condition. The present study compared visual scanpaths
in response to facial expressions and non-facial images
to better inform our understanding of emotion perception
in HA. We evaluated the scan pattern of ocular fixations
made by 20 non-depressed, cognitively intact HA (age range:
45&#x02013;72 years) as they identified Facial emotion (2 Happy, 2
Sad) and Landscape (2 Forest, 2 Canyon) images presented
for 8 seconds. Facial and Landscape images were judged as
equally recognizable by 28 independent observers. Mean fixation
duration and number of fixations made to Facial and
Landscape images did not differ. Participants fixated longer
in the right visual hemifield (RVF) of Facial than of Landscape
images. Examining scan patterns by image type showed
that more fixations were made in the RVF for Sad than for
Happy and Landscape (Canyon) images, and fixation durations
were longer in the RVF for Sad than for Landscape
(Canyon) images. No correlations with age were found. This
study extends previous studies of visual scanpaths in relation
to facial expressions and compares these patterns to those
elicited by non-facial images. We report a specific RVF bias
for facial expressions, especially of negative emotion, compared
to non-facial images, reflecting a preference for attending
to the more expressive left hemiface. We suggest that enhanced
fixation in the RVF increases the amount of information
available to the left hemisphere and may help coordinate
fine-grained local analyses with holistic processes in the left
and right hemispheres respectively.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Support: NIA grant 5F31AG026166-02 &#x00026; NINDS grant 1R01NS050446-01A2.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14450" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DEVELOPMENTAL ASPECTS OF RECOGNITION OF SPEECH EMOTIONAL PROSODY VALENCE IN STIMULI

The main aim of the present paper was to further
examine the developmental features of cerebral mechanisms
of valence evaluation of speech affective component
which have not yet received extensive study. The speech material
has been obtained by recording of professional actors
emotion portrayals. A brief sentence was of neutral semantic
content. The simulated emotions were neutral, joy, anger.
The neural mechanisms underlying the perception of emotions
of different valences were studied by comparing the
reaction time (RT) and accuracy of recognition (AR) in 42
adults (20&#x02013;35, 36&#x02013;50, 51&#x02013;65 years old). They were exposed
to the stimuli that varied in duration (T) from 0.5 s to 3 s
and were presented either on right or left ear of the subject.
The results of AR and RT were submitted to analyses
of variance. The ANOVA of the data obtained revealed
that &#x0201c;age&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;type of emotion&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;stimuli duration&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;gender&#x0201d;

only a few studies have focused specifically on working
memory in humans. We investigated the effect of acute exposure
to a Cold Pressor Stress test (CPS; i.e., insertion of
the dominant hand into ice water for 60 s) during the Sternberg
Working Memory task and the Virtual Morris Water
Maze task. The tasks were administered at 20 and 40 minutes
after the CPS, respectively. To examine the involvement
of sympathetic nervous system and hypothalamicpituitaryadrenocortical
(HPA) axis activation during CPS, we measured
heart rate, skin conductance and salivary cortisol at
selected time points before, during and after the stress procedure.
Exposure to the CPS test was associated with a significant
increase in heart rate and skin conductance, but no
increase in salivary cortisol. Exposure to the stress procedure
facilitated learning performance in both learning paradigms.
The present results indicate that acute stress can enhance
working memory performance in healthy human subjects
even in absence of a significant HPA axis activation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14604" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>REPEATED EXPOSURE TO A NOVEL ENVIRONMENT; EVALUATING THE ADAPTIVE CAPACITY IN THE BALB/C

in its nature. When anxiety responses are in appropriate
or prolonged, that is, non-adaptive, they can lead to long
lasting (neuro) physiological changes and finally to various
forms of pathological anxiety. In animals anxiety might be
defined as pathological if it appears to lack adaptive value
and severely interferes with normal interaction of the sufferer
with its physical and social environment. In this experiment
we aimed at evaluating whether the highly anxious phenotype
of BALB/c mice represents a pathological, that is, nonadaptive
form of anxiety. We investigated 2 inbred mouse
strains, the BALB/c and the 129/J male mice and tested them
40 times (4 trials/day) for 5 minutes per trial in the modified
hole board test. The results show that the BALB/c mice initially
demonstrated significantly more avoidance behaviour
as well as risk assessment than 129/J mice. The initially higher
anxious BALB/c individuals subsequently habituated to the
test situation, and showed increased escaping behaviour. In
contrast, the 129/J strain starting at a lower anxious level than
the BALB/c mice, showed no habituation in avoidance behaviour
throughout the test period. Habituation in BALB/c
mice was also seen in other parameters such as exploratory
activity and locomotion whereas no apparent changes in
these parameters were observed in the 129/J strain during
the test period. Notably, stress hormone (corticosterone) responses
to the initial test situation revealed higher corticosterone
levels in BALB/c mice compared to 129/J mice. This
underlines that the BALB/c strain habituates to an initially
stressful novel environment while the 129/J strain probably
lacks adaptive capacity under the same circumstances. Further
investigations are necessary to show whether 129/J mice
are either insensitive for the aversive characteristics of a novel
environment or might be a model for impaired habituation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e14633" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE COMPARTMENTAL, HORMONAL AND CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSES TO NOISE STRESS

play a key role in the pathophysiology of stress-related disorders,

of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and hippocampus

demonstrated that the DLPFC-hippocampus circuitry is crucial
for memory suppression in humans [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In this study we
aim to explore with functional MRI whether the suppression

<bold>Conclusions</bold>: These preliminary data suggest the presence of dysfunctional DLPFC-hippocampus circuitry during memory suppression in patients with either MD or BPD. This may be due to impaired suppression of hippocampus by
the DLPFC. Hypothetically, alterations of such neuronal network may impair the mechanism of repression of unwanted
memories in MD and BPD, playing a major role for the psychopathology of these disorders.</p></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B37"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sala</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Perez</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Soloff</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Stress and hippocampal abnormalities in psychiatric disorders</article-title><source><italic>European Neuropsychopharmacology</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>14</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>393</fpage><lpage>405</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15336301</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B38"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Ochsner</surname><given-names>KN</given-names></name><name><surname>Kuhl</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Neural systems underlying the suppression of unwanted memories</article-title><source><italic>Science</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>303</volume><issue>5655</issue><fpage>232</fpage><lpage>235</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14716015</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B39"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name><name><surname>Green</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Suppressing unwanted memories by executive control</article-title><source><italic>Nature</italic></source><year>2001</year><volume>410</volume><issue>6826</issue><fpage>366</fpage><lpage>369</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11268212</pub-id></element-citation></ref></ref-list></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15027" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE EFFECTS OF SEX AND STRESS ON AVIAN COGNITION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Olivia</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l280">

may influence behaviour, memory and the brain's response
to stress hormones. Females have a much greater incidence
of some mental disorders, especially those that are stressrelated
such as generalized anxiety. Despite the above, female
animals are rarely tested in experiments and little is known
about the interplay between sex and stress hormones in cognition.
My overall aim is to investigate this relationship in
the zebra finch, using a spatial and non-spatial version of a
one-trial associative memory task. Birds will be trained and
tested to find food hidden under flaps, using either the location
or colour of the flap. Initially the role of sex steroids
is being determined, and performance on this task following
artificially increased and decreased hormone levels is being
examined. Pharmacological manipulations will be used to
determine if testosterone itself or its oestrogen metabolites
are producing effects. The neural basis of those effects will
be investigated through examination of hippocampal slices.
Performance on this task will then be compared with that
following ingestion of the stress hormone corticosterone, injected
into meal worms. Differential effects of sex and stress
raise the possibility that it might be necessary to develop sex
specific treatments for conditions such as depression, addiction,
schizophrenia, and post-traumatic stress disorder.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15089" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF THE EFFECTS OF INJECTIONS OF SUBSTANCE P INTO THE DORSAL

only SP-100 ng increased the extracellular level of serotonin

in the VH, caused significant anxiolytic effects on the exploratory
behavior of rats in the EPM. Therefore, it appears
that the observed interaction of SP and 5-HT mechanisms in
the VH is not implicated in the expression of fear responses
to the height and openness of the EPM. On the other hand,
these aversive states may be mediated by SP-mediated mechanisms

neurogenesis, pointing to a role of the lack of new cells
and new connections in the cognitive and emotional symptoms
of mood disorders, and to neurogenesis as a possible
target/mechanism for antidepressants actions. Selective serotonin
reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), although induce an immediate
increase in the extracellular levels of serotonin and noradrenalin,
need 3&#x02013;4 weeks to develop both therapeutic effects
and increased neurogenesis. This evidence highlights
the existence of other relevant mediating mechanisms in the
course of depression and antidepressant actions. The amygdala
has been related to the both the etiology and the recovery
of depression which has also been linked to increased expression
of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF). Here, we
hypothesized that the amygdala might play a key role in both
therapeutic effects and neurogenic action of antidepressants.
In order to test this hypothesis, amygdala or sham lesions
were conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats and after recovery,
animals were behaviorally characterized in a variety of tasks
selected to evaluate anxiety- and depression-like behaviors,
social interactions, and memory function. They were then
submitted either to acute or chronic treatment with the SSRI
fluoxetine and subsequently tested for a variety of behaviors.
The results show an interaction between amygdala lesions
and fluoxetine treatments over both behavioral outcomes
and hippocampal neurogenesis. Particularly, chronic fluoxetine
treatment enhanced neurogenesis and reduced anxietyand
depression-like behaviors whereas acute treatment reduced
neurogenesis and increased anxiety-like behaviors; interestingly,
in both cases acute and chronic fluoxetine treatment,
amygdala lesions suppressed these neurogenic and behavioral
effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15270" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>WHAT'S SO FUNNY&#x02014;RAT 50-KHZ VOCALIZATIONS AS

fluid using microdialysis on freely moving, conscious rats
can be used to directly correlate stressors with neuronal response.
Catecholamines and noradrenalin release in particular
is involved in a wide array of neurological pathways and
is widely accepted as having a direct correlation to stressful
stimuli as part of the hypothalamus-pituitary axis and the locus
coeruleus-norepinephrine systems. The aim of this study
is to determine the effect of rat turning and turning speed
upon rat turning behaviour and hippocampal levels of noradrenaline
and corticosterone, in order to minimize stress,
limitation of movement and other confounding factors in
microdialysis studies. Three groups of rat setups were examined:
fast to slow turning, slow to fast turning and a liquid swivel. Rat turning behaviour was recorded digitally over a
period of forty-five hours. Brain samples were taken twice
for two hours in twenty-four hours and analysed for corticosterone
and noradrenalin with radio immuno assay and
liquid chromatography coupled to electrochemical detection
respectively. The results show a significant difference in total
turning time between the first day/night and the second
day/night in both turning setups, meaning that it takes et
least twelve hours before the rats are adapted to the turning
apparatus. These results are confirmed by a decrease of
hippocampal corticosterone and noradrenalin levels during
the second day compared to the first day in both turning setups.
The slow to fast turning setup showed enhanced slow
movement and therefore a higher total turning compared to
the fast to slow turning setup. Therefore, these results reveal
that the adaptation period to the turning apparatus and the
turning speed in microdialysis studies require careful consideration
when interpreting data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15410" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ACTIVITY CHANGES IN MICE SUBJECTED TO CHRONIC MILD STRESS: A PIVOTAL POINT FOR STRESS

enjoys a certain popularity in psychiatric research - not least
due to its face validity and comprehensive readout. However,
the results are difficult to replicate in different labs. The goal
of the present study was to examine the influence of stressinduced
changes in general activity on the behavioural readout.
We particularly focussed on the influence of light as a
widely used stressor in CMS protocols on subsequent measures.
A weekly CMS schedule consisting of common mild
stressors was applied for at least 4 weeks to different strains
of mice. During this stress period saccharin intake and preference
over water was acquired twice a week, each time during
the first 2 hours of the dark phase. To exclude interventions
with a putatively high impact on consuming behaviour
per se, food and water deprivation was omitted. Parameters
were assessed using tests like open field, modified holeboard
and long-termhome cage observation. Independent of
the illumination conditions in the behavioural tests, an apparently
paradox decrease in anxiety-related behaviour after
CMS was observed. This could be explained by a generally
increased stress-induced activity, which in turn appeared as
reduced risk assessment behaviour. Preceding application of
a single footshock normalised the latter in CMS mice. While
no enduring decrease in saccharin intake (&#x02018;anhedonia&#x02019;) due
to CMS was observed, over-night illumination as particular
stressor of the weekly paradigm turned out to be associated
with a significant decrease in saccharin intake during
the measurement period the day after. Taken together, these
results suggest that in mice the CMS regimen as a whole
causes hyperreactivity to a novel environment represented by
the test situation and therefore requires careful interpretation
of behaviour. Shifts in circadian rhythms due to light cycle
changes may mimic an &#x02018;anhedonic&#x02019; effect of CMS.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15493" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NON-CONSCIOUS EMOTIONAL CONTAGION IN BLINDSIGHT</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Tamietto</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l286">

typically observed with facial electromyography (EMG).
Here we explored whether this automatic reaction occurs
even in the absence of visual awareness for the stimulus, and
whether this can be elicited also by bodily expressions. Facial
and bodily expressions of happiness and fear were presented
either in the intact visual field or in the blind field of two
well-known hemianope patients (DB and GY) with striate
cortex lesions but residual vision (blindsight). The patients
were required to judge the emotional expression of the pictures
presented in their intact visual field, and &#x0201c;to guess&#x0201d; the
expression of the unseen pictures shown in their blind field.
During the task we recorded emotion-specific facial muscle
activity (zygomaticus major for happy, corrugator supercilii
for fear). Despite both patients reported no visual awareness
for stimuli projected in the blind field and commented their
performance as &#x0201c;at chance&#x0201d;, their evaluation of the emotional
expressions was significantly above chance-level for faces and
bodies alike. Most notably, unseen facial as well as bodily expressions
produced a congruent emotional reaction in patients'
face, comparable to that observed in response to consciously
perceived pictures. Our findings provide evidence
that facial expressions in the observer may unfold as an automatic
reaction that results from emotional contagion. This
expressive response seems insensitive to visual awareness and
to the specific perceptual features of the stimuli. Rather, it appears
to be modulated by the emotional valence of external
events.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15591" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SUBDIVISIONS OF THE ARCOPALLIUM ARE DIFFERENTIALLY INVOLVED IN THE CONTROL OF

has motivated research on the neurobiology of fear
reactions in birds. In the avian brain, the arcopallium has
been suspected to play a major role in the control of fear reactions.
This structure is considered as a partial homologue of the mammalian amygdale, on the basis of developmental
and anatomical data. Moreover, lesions or stimulations of
the arcopallium induce respectively a decrease or an increase
in fear reactions. However, the arcopallium is a large and heterogeneous
structure and the specific roles of its subdivisions
are unknown. The present study aimed at investigating the
respective implications of different subdivisions of the arcopallium
in the control of fear behaviour. Adult Japanese quail
were given bilateral electrolytic lesions of the arcopallium
or sham-operation, and were subsequently placed in several
tests of fear: open-field, hole-in the-wall box, tonic immobility
and novel object tests. Quail with lesions of the anterior
part of the arcopallium exhibited reduced fear behaviour
when compared to sham-operated quail. By contrast, quail
with lesions in the caudal part of the arcopallium tended to
show more pronounced fear behaviour than sham-operated
quail. The behaviour of quail with combined lesions of the
anterior and caudal parts of the arcopallium was not significantly
different from that of shamoperated quail. Those results
are the first to show a differential involvement of subdivisions
of the arcopallium in the control of fear behaviour
in birds. The results will be discussed in the light of current
knowledge regarding the neuroanatomical characteristics of
the arcopallium.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15626" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EFFECTS OF HOUSING ENVIRONMENT ON ACTIVITY AND ANXIETY LEVEL IN MALE AND FEMALE MICE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Puigcerver</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l290">

individual or social housing on various tests of anxiety in
mice of both sexes. After an 18-day isolation period or grouphousing,
general activity of each mouse in the actimeter and
in the open-field test was recorded for 5 min. Afterwards, the
animals were individually placed onto the central square of
the elevated plus-maze and video recorded for 5 min. The
number of counts in the actimeter and number of crossings
from one square to another in the openfield were registered
as measures of activity, and also the number of closed arm
entries in the elevated plus-maze. The percentage of time on
the central square of the openfield, together with the percentage
of time spent on the open arms and the percentage of
open arm entries were scored as measures of anxiety level.
Individual housing increased the activity on both open-field
and actimeter, this increase being really due to the effect of
isolation on the females, because when sexes were analysed
separately, individually housed females showed higher activity
than those socially housed, however, housing conditions
had no effect on males. Furthermore, isolated females displayed
higher activity in the actimeter than isolated males.
Individual housing also increased the general activity ofmice
on the elevated plus-maze, but equally in both sexes. The females
displayed more anxiety than males, spending less time
on the central square of the open-field. This effect was not
due to sex differences in general locomotion, because it was
precisely the females which presented more activity in this
behavioural test. Nevertheless, neither the individual housing
condition nor the sex produced significant differences
in anxiety on the plus-maze. These results indicate that social
housing can reduce the hyperactive response to novelty
in females, whereas in males, the housing environment did
not have a significant effect on activity or performance in the
anxiety test.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15687" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>WHAT CAN NAPLES HIGH EXCITABILITY AND SPONTANEOUSLY HYPERTENSIVE RATS TELL US

problem affecting 1&#x02013;3%of school children,
mainly boys (4 : 1 ratio). It is characterized by inattention,
hyperactivity and impulsivity. An altered mesocorticolimbic
dopamine (DA) system is thought to be associated to different
variants of ADHD. The Naples High Excitability (NHE)
and the Spontaneously Hypertensive (SHR) rats model the
variant with altered executive functions and response inhibition
respectively. The NHE show hyperactive mesocortical
DA branch by hypertrophic DA neurons, high expression of
tyrosine hidroxylase (TH), high DA D2 receptor density and
overexpression of DA-related phosphoprotein (DARP32) in
the mesencephalon. Conversely they show in the prefrontal
cortex (PFC) more axonal varicosities, high DA transporter
(DAT) density and lower DA D1 and D2 receptors. Moreover
the mesotriatal branch is not altered as shown by TH,
DAT, DA D1 and D2 receptors and DARP32. Treatment
with methylphenidate (MPH; 3 mg/Kg i.p. for 14 days) reverses
the basal profile. In contrast, the SHR show altered
mesolimbic and mesocortical branches associated with no
main changes in the mesencephalon but with a high responsiveness
for TH expression and no responsiveness for DA D2
autoreceptors to MPH treatment. Conversely in the PFC a
higher basal DA tone (Carboni et al. 2003, 2004) is associated
with high DAT density (Watanabe et al. 1997) and higher DA
D1 and D2 receptors (Carey et al., 1998). In addition in the
striatum DA D1 and D2 receptors show high density due to
altered pruning that is reversed by MPH treatment. Moreover
DA reuptake system is defective as shown in synaptosome
preparations (Leo et al., 2003). Thus, both high and low
functional state of mesocorticolimbic DA branches may be associated with impaired response inhibition, attention and
executive functions.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by a COFIN-MIUR 2006, 2007 grant.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15769" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DO HOUSING CONDITIONS AFFECT THE BEHAVIOUR OF RESTRAINT-STRESSED MALE AND FEMALE MICE

the vulnerability to develop severe mental illnesses such as
depression and anxiety disorders. Previous clinical studies
have associated the development of these psychological disturbances
with stressful situations. Thus, the present study
was designed to determine the impact of medium stress (restraint)
on activity and anxiety levels of male and female
CD1 mice which were previously housed in different conditions,
isolated or social, for 18 days. After this period, while
the control animals continued in their home cages, the experimental
mice were immobilized for 2 hours. Afterwards,
the animals were tested in the elevated plus-maze for 5 min.
The number of entries into open and closed arms, as a measure
of activity, the percentage of time spent in the open
arms and the percentage of open arm entries, as measures
of anxiety, were scored by a trained observer, blind with respect
to the housing and treatment conditions. The activity
was higher in individually than socially housed mice, and
the restraint produced a decrease in the locomotion of all
animals. However, when the effect of stress on mice of the
two housing conditions was analysed separately, this reduction
of activity was only observed in socially housed subjects.
Similarly, socially housed mice presented a higher level
of anxiety than those individually housed, but restraint only
increased anxiety in socially housed mice, females showing
more anxiety than males. In conclusion, individual housing
annulled the effects of acute stress on animal behaviour
and sex differences observed. This research may help to understand
the biological basis of sex differences in the vulnerability
to stress diseases and their interaction with social
isolation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15830" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EMOTIONAL MEMORY AND MIGRAINE</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gasbarri</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l296">

than neutral events. In the present study we evaluated
the effects of emotional content on explicit memory
in cephalalgic patients, suffering from migraine headache.
We utilized an adaptation of two versions of the same story,
with different arousing properties (neutral or emotional),
which have been already employed in several studies focused
on the enhancing effects of emotions on memory retention.
Subjects of this study were healthy subjects and
cephalalgic patients, which included untreated migraineurs
and migraineurs treated with the antidepressant amitriptyline.
Our findings suggested that chronic migraine is related
to memory impairment. Taking into account that migraine
is associated with major depression, in the present
research the effect of the antidepressant amitriptyline was
also evaluated. Our results showed that amitriptyline has an
impairment effect on memory. In fact, the untreated migraineurs
recalled the most emotional phase of the arousal
story significantly better compared to migraineurs treated
with amitriptyline. Then, our data suggest that amitriptyline
prevents the enhancing effects of emotional content on
memory processes. Moreover, in agreement with the results
we reported in previous papers, the present study confirms
the existence of gender differences in the processing of emotional
stimuli and underscores the view that the gender influences
should be considered in future studies on neural
correlates of emotion, and on the relation of emotion to
memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e15940" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TRANSGENERATIONAL TRANSMISSION OF ENVIRONMENTALLY-INDUCED BEHAVIORAL TRAITS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Franklin</surname><given-names>T.

mental stress, is a contributing factor to the development of
behavioral and emotional disorders. These disorders not only
persist throughout life, but are often heritable. To investigate
their potential mechanisms of occurrence and transmission,
we modeled early trauma in the mouse using chronic and
unpredictablematernal separation, and examined the impact
on adult behavior in two consecutive generations. Mice subjected
to maternal separation behaved abnormally when exposed
to novel or stressful conditions in adulthood and displayed
depressive-like behaviors. Strikingly, their offspring
exhibited similar impairments, despite being reared in normal

mechanisms. Preliminary evidence indicates that alteration

of male offspring from dams that were administered
25% CR at one of four times in the perinatal period:
a brief period preconception, during gestation, during lactation,
or lifelong (gestation, lactation, &#x00026; continuing postweaning)

Furthermore, serum testosterone was significantly higher in
the preconception and lifelong groups than controls. The fear
responses to auditory fear conditioning were also assessed
in these animals. The lactation group was found to spend
more time freezing during extinction and maintained the
fear response longer than the other groups. These findings

receptor of NT-3, (TgNTRK3), that has been validated
as a mouse model for anxiety/panic disorder, to study
the neuroendocrine and behavioral consequences of stress.
We have used differential lightening conditions, novel environment,
restraint, and morphine abstinence as stressors
with physical and/or psychological components. The analysis
of corticosterone levels revealed no apparent alterations
in hypothalamus-pituitaryadrenal (HPA) axis in TgNTRK3
under basal conditions or after exposure to a mild stressor,
such as the open field. However, TgNTRK3 mice showed a
higher increase in corticosterone levels after a more intense
stressful stimulus, as is restraint in tube. Restraint also caused
a lower increase of CRH mRNA in TgNTRK3 paraventricular
nucleus of the hypothalamus, an effect that may be explained
due to an enhanced negative-feedback response in
CRH synthesis by a higher increase in corticosterone secretion.
Anxiety-like behavior was tested after chronically increased
levels of diurnal illumination intensity. In the lightdark
box, stressed TgNTRK3 mice showed a tendency to
spend less time in the light compartment and a similar activityexploratory
behavior than the non-stressed TgNTRK3
group. On the other hand, immobilization in a wooden
board in combination with social isolation showed a different
HPA axis response in TgNTRK3 mice. Finally, after morphine
withdrawal TgNTRK3 showed a higher increase of corticosterone
levels as compared to wild types. These results
may reflect different stress responses and coping strategies in
TgNTRK3 mice that suggest a role of this neurotrophin receptor
in the habituation process to chronic stress situations
and in theHPA axis response after drug dependence.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This work was funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education and Sciences SAF-2004-02808 and GEN2003-20651-C06-

and was suggested as a model of induced predisposition for
these disorders (Avital and Richter-Levin, 2005; Tsoory and

juvenility and in adulthood, but increased levels of CORT
seems to be involved in both. Taken together, this differential

neurons in the brain. The corticotropin-releasing hormone(CRH) and norepinephrine(NE) are suggested to play
a role in modulating the central stress response. In previous

hydroxylase(TH) immunoreactivity(-ir) in the LC of rats
treated with chronic variable stress(CVS) for 14 days. Furtheremore
a novel stressor produced an enhanced response
of the TH-ir after CVS. In the present study we examined
the effect of CVS on the glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD)-
ir activity of periaqueductal gray(PAG), prepositus hypoglossi(
PrH) and peri-LC. The GAD-ir was significantly increased
in PrH and peri-LC after CVS. The footshockinduced

CVS. Moreover, we investigated the influence of the CRH receptor

reward-related processes of both natural (food, sweet taste)
and artificial reinforcers (opioidergic drugs such morphine),
sexual behaviour is generally inhibited by opioids. In order
to better understand the role of opioids in sex-related reward,
we analyse the effects of opioid agonists and antagonists
on the rewarding properties of male sexual pheromones
for female mice [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. We compare the effects of these drugs on
sexual pheromones reward with those on a &#x02018;classical&#x02019; nonsexual
natural reinforcer, namely sucrose sweetness. To do so
we have analysed the effects i.p. injections of the general opioid
antagonist naloxone (1&#x02013;10 mg/kg) and of the <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>-agonist
fentanyl (0.1&#x02013;0.5 mg/kg) on a number of reward-related behaviours
involving attraction to male chemosignals and sucrose
consumption.Naloxone treatment did not affect the innate
preference displayed by female mice for male chemosignals
in two-choice tests against female chemosignals. In contrast,
even low doses of fentanyl strongly inhibited that preference.
On the other hand, the drugs had differential effects
on the preference for consuming a 5% sucrose solution confronted
with tap water. Thus, whereas naloxone inhibited sucrose
preference, fentanyl had no effect. These results suggest
that opioidergic inhibition of sexual behaviour might
be due to impaired processing of pheromonal cues, at least
in macrosmatic rodents, and that hedonic value of tasty solutions
and sexual pheromones are under different opioid
modulation.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work is funded by the Spanish MEC and European FEDER (BFU2004- 04272/BFI) and the Junta de Comunidades

<bold>Background and Purpose</bold>: Ascorbate, the endogenous form of vitamin C, is found in high concentration in the nigrostriatal system, where it appears to function as an extracellular neuromodulator. Several studies have observed that patients with several symptoms of schizophrenia have lower plasma or cerebrospinal fluid ascorbic acid concentrations. The authors conducted a trial of ascorbic acid in schizophrenic patients to evaluate its therapeutic effects.</p><p>
<bold>Materials and Methods</bold>: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial 40 patients with schizophrenia were assigned to haloperidol plus ascorbic acid or haloperidol plus placebo. After a washout period, 20
patients received 20 mg/day of haloperidol plus placebo and 20 received haloperidol plus 1500 mg/day of ascorbic
acid for 6 weeks. Analysis of data was done by repeated measure analysis of variance (ANOVA), Newman-Keuls and
Spearmans Coefficient Rank Correlation and Chi square method.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: Over 6 weeks, the ascorbic acid group showed significantly greater improvement in scores on total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and on positive, negative and general symptoms subscales. The total symptoms score decreased at
the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th week, positive symptoms score decreased at the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th week,
negative symptoms score decreased at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th week, and general symptoms score decreased at the
3rd and 6th week.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusion</bold>: Oral supplementation of vitamin C with conventional antipsychotic drugs can be used in the treatment of schizophrenia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16438" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>IMPAIRED FEAR EXTINCTION AND HIPPOCAMPAL LTP IN VGLUT1<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> BUT NOT

In the present study, examination of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2

extinction of conditioned fear and in hippocampal synaptic
plasticity. A conditioned emotional response procedure
was used to study fear-induced response suppression and extinction.
In the scheduled training phase, all mice learned

less than VGLUT2<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> and littermate control mice.
During 8 CER acquisition trials, tone-shock presentations
suppressed nosepoke responding to a similar degree in all

without footshocks), all mice gradually resumed
nosepoking, but rateindependent suppression ratio calculations
indicated that VGLUT1<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup> mice were slower to extinguish

which is the CA1 field of the hippocampus. Neuroprotective compounds can prevent pyramidal cell death in the CA1
area, and robust effect in a global ischemia test is an important criterion for selecting drug candidates for the treatment
of stroke. Reliability of the results is crucial for the prediction of human usefulness, which can be supported by
results demonstrating lack of differences in efficacy across rat strains. For this reason we evaluated and compared the
neuroprotective activity of GYKI 53405, a non-competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, in transient global cerebral ischemia
produced by clamping both carotid arteries for 10 min in male Wistar and SPRD rats, in which both vertebral
arteries had been occluded by electro-coagulation (4VO). Neuronal degeneration in the CA1 field was quantified with
the Gallyas silver staining technique 4 days after 4VO. GYKI 53405, injected 30 min after reperfusion at 30 mg/kg i.p., reduced
pyramidal cell loss in the CA1 area by 49% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in Sprague Dawley (SPRD) rats. Surprisingly, GYKI 53405 produced no effect in Wistar rats. Administration of a large dose of NBQX, a competitive AMPA receptor antagonist, at
60, 75 and 85 min after reperfusion (30 mg/kg i.p. all) decreased neuronal cell necrosis less in Wistar (47%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) than in SPRD rats (91%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Treatment with 7- nitroindazole, a neuronal nitric monoxide inhibitor, at the start of occlusion and 50 min after reperfusion at 25 mg/kg i.p. (both) rescued 40% and 31% of CA1 neurons in Wistar and SPRD rats, respectively. In conclusion, the neuroprotective effects of AMPA receptor antagonists were quantitatively different in Wistar and Sprague Dawley rats after global cerebral ischemia, and these findings can have significant implications for further development of AMPA antagonists for the treatment of stroke.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16584" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>OCTOPRESSIN INFLUENCES LONG-TERM RETENTION OF A PASSIVE AVOIDANCE TASK IN THE CUTTLEFISH,

homologues on osmoregulation, OT and VP appear to play a key role in behavioral regulation including learning and
memory. Several related peptides have been identified from diverse invertebrate species (viz., annelids, arthropods, molluscs).
Moreover, it is interesting to note that two members of the OT/VP superfamily, cephalotocin and octopressin (OP),

two members of the OT/VP superfamily in an invertebrate species. Some of these OT-like and VP-like peptides seem to
be involved in peripheral processes similar to that noted in mammals. However, there is no data to date, concerning their

CNS activity of Lotus corniculatus plant extract. The effects
of the extract (100 mg/kg) on explatory behaviour, depression
level, spontaneous motor activity and motor coordination
were investigated in mice. Intraperitonal (i.p) administration
of the extract induced a significant decrease in
exploratory behaviour in hole-board tests and spontaneous
motor activity in activity cage measurements and increase in
immobilitiy time in tail suspension tests. On the other hand,
the extract failed to inhibit motor coordination in Rota-Rod
tests. The decrease in vertical and horizantal motor activity
and exploratory behaviour indicates the reduce in CNS excitability
which might be closely related to sedation based
on depression of the CNS. In spite of decreased spontaneous
motor activity in the activity cage, changes on motor coordination
in Rota-Rod test was not significant suggesting an effect
unrelated with neuromuscular blockage. Increase in the
immobility time in tail suspension test pointed out the antidepressant
like activity of the plant extract. Further studies
are neccesary to explain the mechanisms of this antidepressant

create a mouse model of demyelination. However, the effects
on behavior of cuprizone-treatment have not been previously
reported. We have analyzed the behavioral changes
of mice given a diet containing 0.2% cuprizone for 6 weeks
followed by 6 weeks of recovery. Behavior was assessed using
a range of tests: the functional observation battery, the
open-field test, and the rota-rod test. Concurrent with the
start of demyelination, at 3 and 4 weeks of 0.2% cuprizone
treatment, the animals exhibited an increase in central nervous
system activity and an inhibited anxiogenic response
to the novelty challenge test. At 5 weeks of treatment (the
period of maximal demyelination) equilibrium was altered
and sensorimotor reactivity was also affected. Further, rotarod
analysis demonstrated that the treated group had poorer
motor coordination than control animals. This effect was not
reversed 6 weeks after cuprizone withdrawal. The animals in
the recovery period also exhibited difficulties in the rota-rod
progressive learning task. Our results indicate that behavioral

oralis (RPO) is one of the crucial structures for the regulation
of hippocampal theta rhythm, but involvement of rostral
and caudal parts of this structure is different. The caudal
part is effective in inducing theta rhythm while the rostral
part of the RPO may contain neurons which inhibit the theta
via unknown transmitter. At least a part of these inhibitory
neurons could be glycinergic, because strychnine (a glycine
receptor antagonist) microinjections released the theta activity
as we found in our previous studies; now we tested the
GABA transmission involvement. In the present experiment
the effect of GABAA receptor blockade in the rostral part of
the RPO on hippocampal theta rhythm was examined in urethaneanesthetized
rats. Male Wistar rats (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were implanted
with recording electrodes in the dorsal hippocampus
and received microinjections of GABAA receptor antagonist,
bicuculline (50 ng/0.5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L, over 3&#x02013;6 min) into the rostral
part of RPO. Theta rhythm was induced by sensory stimulation
(60 s tail pinch) in the control condition and every
10 min after bicuculline. The effect of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade
was observed for 1 hour. Unilateral bicuculline injections
induced spontaneous theta episodes without sensory stimulation
in both hippocampi (ipsi- and contralateral to the injection
site), with a mean latency of 207.8 &#x000b1; 11.4 s. Mean duration
time of spontaneous theta episodes was 940.3 &#x000b1; 70.2 s.
The hippocampal EEG signal and the fast Fourier transform
(FFT) power spectra during control theta and theta rhythm after bicuculline were similar. The results obtained indicate
that inhibition of GABA-ergic or GABA-sensitive neurons in
the rostral part of the RPO could elicit the hippocampal theta
activity, the bicuculline effect on theta elicitation we found
even more evident than strychnine.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16845" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE EFFECT OF 5-HT RECEPTORS ACTIVATION IN THE PEDUNCULOPONTINE TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS ON

urethanized rats. The experiments were performed on 7 male
Wistar rats implanted with bilateral recording hippocampal
electrodes and unilateral injection cannula into the PPN. The
animals were maintained at the level of anesthesia at which
spontaneous theta rhythm was not present in hippocampal
EEG, but could be elicited by sensory stimulation (tail pinch
lasting 1 min). The hippocampal EEG was recorded during
the sensory stimulation in the preinjection conditions and
after unilateral injections of 5-CT into the PPN. Microinjection
of 5-CT (1 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>g/0.5 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L, lasted at least 3 min) induced
hippocampal regular spontaneous theta activity in both hippocampi,
with a mean latency of 16.7 &#x000b1; 2.1 min and with
mean duration of 31 &#x000b1; 2.9 min. The hippocampal EEG signal
and fast Fourier transform (FFT) power spectra during control

Clear synchronization of the hippocampal EEG associated
with an increase in FFT power in theta band (3&#x02013;6 Hz) and
power reduction in delta band (0.1&#x02013;3 Hz) were observed. It
is thought that serotonergic system inhibits the mesopontine
cholinergic neurons (the PPN is a part of cholinergic theta
activation system), which activation is crucial for the induction
of theta rhythm in the hippocampus. Presently available
evidence indicates that activation of 5-HT receptors on
PPN neurons generally induce their hyperpolarization. The
results obtained suggest that local inhibition of presumably
cholinergic neurons in the PPN could elicit hippocampal
theta rhythm without sensory stimulation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e16890" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>TESTING OF SELECTIVE AND NONSELECTIVE GABA<sub>(A)</sub> MODULATORS IN THE FOUR-PLATE TEST USING

less sedative effects. Female NMRI mice were used for testing
of the following compounds: diazepam (1, 3, 10 mg/kg) and
chlordiazepoxide (5, 10, 20 mg/kg, both unselective GABA<sub>A</sub>

did not display anxiolytic-like activity at the doses tested.
Zolpidem reduced the number of unpunished crossings
(1&#x00026;10 mg/kg), whereas methamphetamine showed central

grown in the Mediterranean and South Europe. Olive fruits
and oil have been recognized as important components of
a healthy diet because of their polyphenol contents. Olive
leaves have been shown to have similar polyphenolics composition
to olive fruits. Tablets of olive fruit and olive leaf
extracts have been marketed as a dietetic product. The plant
has been shown to have antioxidant, antihypertensive, antiatherogenic,
vasodilatory, antiarythmic, cardioprotective,
antiobesity, hypoglycemic, antiinflammatory, antitumoral,
antimicrobial, antiviral activities.Historically, the olive leaves
have been used for their antimalarial, antipyretic, antiseptic,
astringent, febrifuge and sedative effects. Because of the
lack of information about the central nervous system (CNS)
effects of olive leaves extracts and the historical usage of
the leaves for their sedative effects, we aimed to investigate the CNS activities of this extract. Olive leaves extracts (125&#x02013;
250 mg/kg) was used for this study. Elevated plus maze and
hole board tests for anxiety, activity cage measurements for
spontaneous motor activity, Rota-Rod tests for motor coordination
were studied. Both doses of extracts decreased the
number of head-dips in hole-board tests. Mice spent more
time in closed arms of maze. Significant decreases in the horizontal
and vertical locomotor activities were observed. The
decrease in spontaneous motor activity is an indicator for
decreased excitability of the CNS. This decrease might be
closely related to sedation due to the CNS depression. Decrease
in the exploratory behaviour are in general agreement
with these reports. The decreased spotaneous motor activity
seems to be not related to a neuromuscular blockade, as
Rota-Rod performance was not changed. Rather, the effects
might comprise the neurons that modulate CNS depressant

deficits in adulthood and most epileptic syndromes
are first manifested in infancy or childhood. A variety of
experimental animal models has been developed in order
to clarify the impact of early life seizures in the CNS function.
However, relatively little is known about the longterm
behavioral and neurobiological consequences of early
seizures. Pentylenetetrazol (PTZ), a GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist
causes convulsions that model primary generalized
epilepsy. In the present study the long-termeffects of PTZ administration
(90 mg/kg, i.p.), in early life of male (9 controls,
12 PTZ-treated) and female (19 controls, 15 PTZ-treated)
rats (P18&#x02013;20), were examined. In particular, behavioral responses
such as open field activity, object recognition and
water maze performance were assessed in adult rats of both
sexes. BDNF and neurofilament hippocampal protein levels
were also measured. Adult Female, but not Male, PTZ-treated
animals presented a reduced motor activity. Adult
Male, but not Female, PTZ-treated animals displayed an impaired
ability to recognize a novel object and exhibited learning
but not memory impairment in the Morris water maze
test. Moreover, BDNF hippocampal protein levels were significantly
reduced in Male but not Female PTZ-treated animals.
These findings suggest that a sustained early life convulsion
induced sex dependent behavioral changes linked to
reaction to novelty, spatial and non-spatial memory performance
along with alterations in neurobiological parameters
indicating neuroplasticity. These changes are important for
animal survival, although not directly linked to adult life
epilepsy manifestations (convulsion threshold).</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>The research Project is co-funded by the European Union-European Social Fund (ESF) &#x00026; National Sources, in the

animal model of early life stress. A single 24 hour period of
MD in rats has been associated with a number of abnormalities
in brain and behavior in adulthood. These alterations
seem to be relevant to the neurobiological substrate of
depression or schizophrenia. The present study investigated
specific behavioral and neurobiological parameters in MD as
compared to control rats. Behavioral responses such as the
spontaneous activity in a novel open field apparatus, the habituation
to learning using an open field chamber, the behavior
response to d-amphetamine (d-amp,0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg)
and the susceptibility to apomorphine (1.5 mg/kg), were examined.
Additionally, DARPP-32 striatal protein levels were
also measured. Plasma corticosterone levels were estimated
in both groups of rats. The findings showed that MD rats exhibited
a marginal increase in spontaneous motor activity as
compared to controls. During repeated exposure to the open
field chamber the MD rats exhibited an impaired habituation
to learning in comparison with control rats. MD rats displayed
an exaggerated motor activity following the low dose
of d-amp, compared with control rats. Similar increase was
also observed in MD rats following the high dose of damp
but it did not reach statistical significance. Apomorphine
induced gnawing was markedly increased in MD as compared
to controls. It is noteworthy that striatal DARPP-32
striatal protein levels were increased in MD rats. Compared
to controls, MD rats displayed elevated corticosterone levels.
These findings clearly showed that early maternal deprivation
stress produce long term consequences in distinct behavioral
and neurobiological parameters. These behavioral
modifications are associated with motor activity and cognitive
abilities while they might be linked to alterations in the
dopaminergic function and in the hypothalamic-pituitaryadrenal
axis status.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by GSRT, PENED 2003.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17183" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DEVELOPMENT A NEW MOUSE MODEL TO STUDY LEARNING BEHAVIOUR AND IMPULSIVITY:

for better mouse phenotyping. Intellicage system (New-
Behavior Lab, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland) that monitors automatically
mouse drinking and nose-poking (NP) behaviors of the
four corners with the help subcutaneous personal transponders
was used to study mouse learning behavior and impulsivity
in three different forced drinking regimes. All these
regimes were programmed so that each animal was entitled
to drink clockwise from each corner. The first regime, Radial
(Rd), allowed drinking at large during the visit. Time Limited
(TLm) regime limited the time of one drink for 3 sec but
animals could continue to drink more by NP if they stayed
in the corner. Fixed (Fx) regime limited the time of the drink
for 5 sec and allowed to drink from one corner only once.
C57Bl/J6 males learned successfully on the first day under all
regimes but Fx regime appeared more powerful. The learning
was evaluated as decreased number of incorrect visits.
The impulsivity was evaluated as number of incorrect visits
in each corner as well as number of mistakes between correct
visits. The persistence was calculated as ratio of average
daily incorrect NPs to all NPs in each corner. The learning behavior
was also studied in situation when some water bottles
were replaced by sucrose and quinine solutions that increased
incorrect visits and NPs according to context. Phencyclidine
injections (s.c., 0.93 mg/kg, daily for 7 days) increased impulsivity
and persistence in the replacement situation. Fx forced
drinking regime might be used as a model to analyze mouse
learning behavior and impulsivity and its pharmacological
control.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17244" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DOPAMINERGIC ACTIVITY FACILITATES RETENTION AND RETRIEVAL OF AUDITORY CORTEX-DEPENDENT

the modulation direction of linearly frequencymodulated
tones (FMs). Using a pharmacological approach,
we elucidated the functional significance of the dopamine
(DA) system for FM discrimination learning. When compared
with vehicle-treated controls, bilateral injections of a
DA agonist into the auditory cortex 24 h before or shortly after
the first session of differential conditioning to FMs facilitated
learning of the discrimination reaction. This effect was
sensitive to a D1-like DA receptor antagonist and to protein
synthesis inhibitors. The agonist-induced improvement was
confined to auditory cortex-dependent aspects of the task,
that is, discriminating the conditioned stimuli and/or associating
them with their respective meanings. Acquisition performance
was normal, implying that D1-like DA receptor activation
supports encoding of long-term memory. To assess
effects on mechanisms required for retrieval of the learned
behaviour, the DA agonist was applied to well-trained gerbils
shortly after they repeated the established FM discrimination
reaction in a retraining session. On subsequent days, the
accuracy of FM discrimination monitored at the beginning
of retraining progressively increased in agonisttreated gerbils.
In contrast, the mean discrimination scores per session
were not significantly affected by this treatment. Accordingly,
pharmacological interference with the DA system shortly after
the first session of differential conditioning caused deficits
in the discriminative behaviour that were evident predominantly
during the initial trials of retraining 24 h later. Together,
our findings suggest that DA activity in the gerbil auditory
cortex facilitates consolidation-relevant processes required
for both retention and retrieval of FM discrimination
memory.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by the Land Sachsen-Anhalt.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17292" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>OXYTOCIN ENHANCES STRESS-INDUCED GROOMING BEHAVIOR IN WISTAR RATS; COMPARISON WITH

effects of oxytocin and its partial agonist/antagonist carbetocin
on rat behavior in the open-field device during the
stress. Male Wistar rats were used and immobilization was
applied for 60 minutes. Tested drugs were administered i.p.

pause the behavioral test in the open-field device was performed.
We used a circular arena with diameter 150 cm, and
the behavioral parameters including grooming were videorecorded
and evaluated with the Any Maze software (Stoelting
Co, USA). When compared to controls oxytocin and carbetocin
(in doses 1 mg/kg b.w.) increased slightly grooming
while other parameters in the open-field device differed
according to the measured parameter. The effect of both
drugs substantially differed in the experiment using stress.
Exposure to stress alone increased grooming and oxytocin potently enhanced this behavioral pattern. Carbetocin had
only insignificant increasing effect on grooming in stressed
animals. Restraint stress produced typical decrease of certain
behavioral parameters, like total movement distance or
rearing. Carbetocin very effectively antagonized these stress
effects. Grooming seems to be an important behavioral parameter,
which is useful for evaluation of brain effects of

dose-dependently reduced cerebral infarct size after
permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in mice and
rats. In both species, EGIS-9637 showed stronger neuroprotective
activity (minimal effective dose, MED = 0.3 mg/kg
i.p. in mice and 0.03 mg/kg i.p. in rats) than GYKI 53405
(MED = 3 mg/kg in mice, MED = 10 mg/kg i.p. in rats).
The favourable neuroprotective effect of EGIS-9637 indicates
good clinical perspectives in the treatment of human
ischemic stroke.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17392" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEUROKININ-2 ANTAGONISM INMEDIAL SEPTUM INFLUENCES ACH NEUROTRANSMISSION AND OBJECT

NK2 and NK3 receptors, have been identified in the brain
on cholinergic neurons. NK2 receptors are predominant and
functionally identified in the hippocampus, thalamus, septum
and frontal cortex. Previously it was shown that in the
medial septum NK2 receptor antagonists blocked the increase
of acetylcholine release in the hippocampus induced
by septal NK2-agonist (NKA) administration. Therefore, it
is possible that NK2 receptors in the medial septum can influence
memory and that selective NK2 receptor antagonists
would affect learning and memory by influencing the activity
of the cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain. The intent
of this study was to investigate the action of local application
of the peptidic NK2 receptor antagonist Bz-Ala-Ala-
D-Trp-Phe-D-Pro-Pro-Nle-NH (1, 10 and 100 pmol) into
the medial septum on ACh levels in projection areas of the
cholinergic neurons of the basal forebrain, namely frontal
cortex, amygdala and hippocampus by in vivo microdialysis
and HPLC. Furthermore, we investigated the pharmacological
effect of the NK2 receptor antagonism on object memory
for recency (&#x0201c;what&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;when&#x0201d;) and spatial displacement
(&#x0201c;what&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;where&#x0201d;). Local injection of the NK2 antagonist
into the medial septum decreased ACh levels in the
frontal cortex, amygdala and hippocampus 30 minutes after
pharmacological treatment in a dose dependent manner. The
strongest decrease was observed with 10 pmol treatment. We
also found that vehicle injection into the medial septum impaired
object memory for recency and displacement, which
could partially be reversed by local application of the NK2 receptor
antagonist into the medial septum. The results suggest
a possible role of the NK2 receptor in learning and memory
without influencing the activity of the cholinergic neurons of
the basal forebrain in a direct manner.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17427" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>A RAT VERSION OF THE IOWA GAMBLING TASK REVEALS GOOD AND POOR DECISION-MAKERS

psychiatric disorders like conduct disorders or drug addiction,
in which immediate gratification is chosen at the expense
of long-term goals. Such deficits can be revealed in
the Iowa Gambling Task, designed to mimic complex reallife
decision-making. This task involves conflicting options
in which greatest gains are associated with higher unpredictable
penalties. We devised a rat gambling task based on the same principle. Food-restricted rats had to choose between
four holes, each associated with the delivery of different
amounts of reward followed by unpredictable penalties of
variable duration. Despite the difficulty of the task, most rats
rapidly developed a preference for the more favorable choices
within one session. However, about a quarter of the rats kept
choosing unfavorably options and a minority was undecided.
These reproducible behavioral differences were stable over
time and were not related to a lower motivation to perform
the task or to anxiety levels. Bad decision-makers were not
less sensitive to punishment but tended to take more risk in
a plus-maze and had a higher motivation to collect food reward
in a runway. These results suggest thatmost rats exhibit
capacities of making the best decision in such a complex task
whereas others fail to do so. These findings strikingly parallel
those obtained in humans. Our data support the hypothesis
that poor decision-making in normal individuals is related
to less risk assessment and a higher motivation for food
reinforcement. This task that allows a quick one-trial measure
may facilitate the search for the psychobiological bases
underlying spontaneous or experimental deficits in decision
making.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by CNRS, Universit&#x000e9; Bordeaux2, ANR JC05 44905 to S.

performed.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: 83% of tested NCEs presented affinity higher than 25% in the in vitro binding assay for GABA<sub>A</sub>
<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1 at 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M and sedative-hypnotic effect in mice higher than 60% in inhibition of the spontaneous motor activity test (i-SMA) at 97.6 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/Kg ip. NCEs that showed affinity lower than 25%
at 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup> M, elicit low sedation induction (i-SMA below 60%).
Zolpidem (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1 affinity: 73.6%; i-SMA: 91.7%) and zaleplon
(<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-1 affinity: 23.4%; i-SMA: 47.2%) results fit within this

NCEs, selectivity for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor was tested
against a battery of other central nervous system receptors
at 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M and negligible affinity was found, confirming that
sedation induction can be attributed only to the GABA<sub>A</sub>

Despite the in vivo test was performed during light phase (rodents

receptor plays an important role in the modulation of
food intake in both humans and animals. Previous studies
have revealed that cannabinoid agonists including D9-
tetrahydrocannabinol increase food intake and that this action
can be reversed by CB1 antagonists whereas treatment
with the CB1 antagonists SR141716A or AM251 alone reduces
food intake. The aim of this study was to determine
the effect of AM251 on feeding and exploratory behaviour of
free feeding mice. C57BL6 mice were individually housed in
Phenotyper cages and subjected to a 12/12 hour light/dark
cycle with free access to food and water. The Phenotyper is a
video-based observation system that allows longterm continuous
monitoring of behavioral activity. Animals were given 2
days of habituation prior to being matched for body weight
and allocated to drug groups of AM251 (10 mg/kg) or vehicle
(Tween 80) (administered before dark cycle). The body
weight of the mice, weights of food hoppers and water bottles
were recorded each morning. Motor activity and time spent
in predefined areas of the arena associated with food and water
were also monitored 24 hours per day. An acute injection
of AM251 induced a reduction in body weight and food intake
independent of gender. AM251 treated animals were observed
as spending less time in the area associated with food.
In addition to the effects of AM251 on feeding behaviour the
mice revealed a decrease in activity compared to controls in
the hours following drug treatment. Repeated dosing with
AM251 reduced body weight, food intake and time spent in
areas associated with food and water during 4 days of testing.
These results corroborate previous findings which have observed
that AM251 produces a reduction in food intake and
in turn support a possible therapeutic use of AM251 as an
anorexic drug and treatment for obesity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17642" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>ANTIDEPRESSANT-LIKE EFFECTS OF RIMONABANT IN THE MOUSE FORCED SWIM TEST OCCUR

that predicts the clinical efficacy of many types of antidepressants.
It was the aim of the current study to systematically
evaluate the effects of endocannabinoid modulating
drugs in the mouse FST and to further delineate the underlying
mechanisms. We show that acute treatment with
the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor antagonists SR141716
(rimonabant) and AM251 dose-dependently reduce immobility
in the FST in male C57BL/6N mice without affecting
locomotor activity. This antidepressant-like effect is specific
for CB1 receptors as SR141716 exerts its action only in
CB1 wt, but not in CB1 ko mice. The evaluation of the endocannabinoid
level enhancing drugs URB597, AM404 and
UCM707 did not reveal any influence on immobility in the
FST. Depletion of serotonin or catecholamines via inhibition
of tryptophan hydroxylase and tyrosine hydroxylase, respectively,
did not attenuate antidepressant-like behavioral
or neuroendocrine effects of SR141716. Finally, FST exposure
broadly reduced anandamide levels in the ventromedial
prefrontal cortex (VPC), the nucleus accumbens (NAC), the
basolateral amygdala (BLA), the dorsal hippocampus (DH)
and the raphe nuclei, but not in the caudate putamen (CPU).
2-arachidonyl glycerol levels were downregulated in the DH,
but upregulated in the BLA and CPU. In conclusion, we illustrate
the complexity of the endocannabinoid signaling response
to FST stress and propose that the acute pharmacological
blockade of CB1 receptors can lead to antidepressantlike
effects in the mouse FST, which are likely not mediated
via increased monoaminergic neurotransmission.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Support from: NIH; Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e17775" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>EEG POWER SPECTRUM AND HEART RATE EFFECTS OF RIMONABANT IN THE ANAESTHETISED RAT</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shanks</surname><given-names>E.

dopamine (DA) and noradrenaline (NA) terminals. The aim
of the present experiments was to study the effects of lesions
of catecholamine (CA) terminals in the mPFC on the regulation
of body weight. 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) was
injected bilaterally into the mPFC to destroy CA terminals.
To increase the selectivity of neurotoxin on DA or NA terminals,
6-OHDA was applied after desipramine or GBR12935
pretreatment, respectively. 6-hydroxydopa (6-OHDOPA) lesions
were used to compare the effects of lesions on NA
terminals. The control groups were injected with vehicle or
GBR12935. Daily food and water intake and body weight
were measured to the nearest g and ml, respectively. Regulatory
deficits after 24 h food and water deprivation were also
examined. DA and NA levels were determined in vitro from
micro punched samples of the mPFC. Only transient body
weight decrease was found in all groups with neurochemical
lesions, but the effect of 6-OHDA with desipramine pretreatment
was severe and the most pronounced. Only this group
had an enhanced food intake following 24 h deprivation. 6-
OHDA lesion caused 79.7% decrease in NA and 52.4% decrease
in DA level compared to those of controls. After desipramine
pretreatment 42.5% decrease in NA and 56.5%
decrease in DA level were measured. In the groups of 6-
OHDOPA and GBR12935+6-OHDA the NA levels decreased
by 50% but DA levels increased by +180% and +268.8%, respectively.
Our results show that DA terminals of the mPFC
are involved in the regulation of body weight and that selective

known to influence i.a. the rate of neurogenesis in the dentate
gyrus and spatial memory. We investigated the influence
of injections of the partial 5-HT1A agonist, buspirone, one
month prior to the behavioral tests on the exploratory behavior
and the number of neurons generated at the time of
injections in the adult and aged opossums (Monodelphis domestica).
Exploratory behavior was evaluated in the spatial
novelty test according to Husnaker (2005). Seven six-minute
sessions were performed in one day. In session 1 the exploration
field was empty. In session 2&#x02013;4 five objects were
present there, always in the same places. In session 5-6 placement
of two objects was exchanged. In session 7 one old object
was replaced with a new one. All animals intensely explored
new objects and then habituated. Aged opossums explored
more than adults. Control opossums approached all
new objects, while the buspirone-pretreated explored more
but selectively. Object displacement increased exploration
only in the adults injected with buspirone, while introduction
of a new object increased its exploration in both adult
and aged buspirone-treated groups. Injections of buspirone
raised numbers of newly incorporated neurons in the dentate
DG and OB. These results show that injections of buspirone
may have long-time effects on both adult neurogenesis and
selectivity of the exploratory behavior in the opossum.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18143" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DISSOCIABLE EFFECTS OF SELECTIVE 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> AND 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> RECEPTOR ANTAGONISTS ON SERIAL SPATIAL REVERSAL LEARNING IN RATS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boulougouris</surname><given-names>V.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Robbins</surname><given-names>T.

<bold>Rationale</bold>: Serotonin (5-HT) is strongly implicated in the ability to shift behaviour in response to changing stimulusreward contingencies. However, there is little information on
the role of different 5-HT receptors in reversal learning.</p><p>
<bold>Objectives</bold>: We investigate the effects of the selective 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>
and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonists M100907 and SB 242084 on performance of a spatial discrimination and serial reversal learning task in rats.</p><p>
<bold>Methods</bold>: The effects of systemic administration of M100907
(0, 0.01, 0.03, 0.1 mg/kg IP) and SB 242084 (0, 0.1, 0.3, 1 mg/kg IP) were investigated on an instrumental two-lever
spatial discrimination and serial reversal learning task, where both levers were presented and only one was reinforced. The
rat was required to respond on the reinforced lever under a fixed ratio 3 schedule of reinforcement. Following attainment
of criterion, a series of within session reversals was presented.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: Neither M100907 nor SB 242084 altered performance during spatial discrimination and retention of the
previously reinforced contingencies. M100907 significantly increased both trials to criterion and incorrect responses to
criterion in Reversal 1, a pattern of behaviour manifested as increased perseverative responding on the previously correct
lever. In contrast, SB 242084 improved reversal learning by decreasing trials and incorrect responses to criterion in Reversal
1, with significantly fewer perseverative responses.</p><p>
<bold>Conclusions</bold>: These data support the view that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> and
5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptors have distinct roles in cognitive flexibility
and response inhibition. The improved performance in reversal
learning observed following 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> receptor antagonism
suggests these receptors may offer the potential for therapeutic
advances in a number of neuropsychiatric disorders

novel aspects of their environment (Ennaceur and Delacour,
1988). This has been exploited in tests of recognition memory
for not only objects, but the locations and contexts in
which they appear. Previous studies have frequently shown a
role for the hippocampus in object-location memory in rats
(Save, Poucet et al. 1992; Mumby et al. 2002; Good et al.
2007). However, we have recently found that memory for
objects and the locations in which they are presented is not
dependent on the hippocampus in one version of this task
(Langston &#x00026; Wood, FENS Abstracts 2006), and the same
task is not affected by lesions of the fornix (Eacott &#x00026; Norman,
2004). We aim to explore the differences between the
paradigms used in these studies to determine which manipulations
invoke the involvement of the hippocampus. Rats
received complete bilateral lesions of the hippocampus with
ibotenic acid or sham control operations at the start of
the experiment. Lesioned rats preferentially explored objects
whose locations had been swapped with other objects seen
in the exposure phase over those that had not been swapped.
This was dependent on the rats entering the test box at the
same location on the exposure and test phases and therefore
being able to use an egocentric strategy. When placed into
the test box at a location that differed from that used in the
exposure phase, hippocampal lesioned rats no longer preferentially
explored objects in swapped locations, suggesting
that an allocentric strategy may have been necessary. These
data are consistent with a role for the hippocampus in allocentric,
but not egocentric, spatial processing, and may provide
a framework for understanding the circumstances under
which the hippocampus is required for spontaneous objectlocation
recognition memory.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18233" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION AND SLEEP IN THE DOMESTIC CHICK (<italic>GALLUS GALLUS</italic>)</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bobbo</surname><given-names>D.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nelini</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Quercia</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mascetti</surname><given-names>G.

some time windows, called critical periods, in which the sensory
activity induces neural modifications in the brain. Such
functional and behavioral changes are aspects of a more general
function known as neural plasticity. In neurons of the
cats primary visual cortex, the closure of one eye (monocular
deprivation) during the critical period causes a shift in
eye dominance toward the nondeprived eye and a reduction
of vision and visual acuity of the closed eye (Hubel e Wiesel,
1970). In domestic chicks (Gallus gallus), brain functions are
remarkably lateralized (Andrew, 2002) but there are no indications
on the presence of critical periods. In this species the
pattern of lateralization changes during the first two weeks
after hatching, shifting from an overall left hemisphere dominance
during the first week to the right hemisphere one in the
second week. Chicks also exhibit monocular/unihemispheric
sleep (MoUn sleep), a unique behavioral and electrophysiological
state in which, during sleep, one hemisphere is awakened
while the other remains sleeping. We used 18 young female
chicks of two days posthatching that underwent to 12
hours monocular deprivation by placing an eyepatch made

in the patterning of axonal connections during brain
development, but until now a role for these molecules in
the mature brain has not been clearly described. Environmental
enrichment increases adult hippocampal neurogenesis
and alters hippocampal-dependent behaviors in rodents.
We housed juvenile and adult C57/BL6 mice in an enriched
environment condition to examine the possibility that
experience-dependent stimulation induces modifications in
the expression of EphrinA5 and its receptor in the hippocampus.
After an eight-week training, animals were challenged
by the context-dependent fear conditioning test, a behavioral
paradigm sensitive to hippocampal modifications, and by the
cue-dependent fear conditioning test, which relies on amygdala
functions, but is not affected by hippocampal plasticity.
We found that enriched mice performance was better than
that of non-enriched mice in the context-dependent fear
conditioning test but not in the cue-dependent fear conditioning
test. Both dendritic arborization and dendritic spine
density of hippocampal neurons of enriched mice were increased
with respect to their control countermates, as revealed
by Golgi-Cox staining. We used western blot and immunofluorescence
analysis to assay the expression of Ephrin-
A5 and its receptor Eph-A5 in different areas of the brain,
hippocampus, cortex and striatum, of enriched and nonenriched
animals. Expression of both Ephrin-A5 and its receptor
in the hippocampi of enriched animals appeared to
correlate with their increased neuronal plasticity. Effects of
these results on spine cytoskeletal structure and on behavioral

of the androgens like testosterone into estrogens like 17-betaestradiol
in the brain, gonads and adipose tissue. Although
aromatase is expressed mainly in neurons during adulthood,
it can be expressed by astrocytes pre- and perinatally and
also under stress conditions. Glial cells have been traditionally
neglected in the study of behavior, but its crucial role
in brain function is nowadays beginning to be recognized.
In particular, astrocytes modulate synaptic transmission influencing
neurotransmitter levels and neuronal excitability.
Since astrocytes are the main cellular targets for the action
of gonadal steroids, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these
cells would be especially sensible to the organizational effects
of sex steroids, thus influencing behavior. For this purpose,
anastrozole, a selective aromatase inhibitor, was administered
daily to pregnant rats (0.01 mg/kg, i.p) from day 17 of
gestation until parturition. After birth, all pups were injected
daily with anastrozole (0.1 mg/kg, i.p) until postnatal day 19.
A different group of animals (males and females) received
anastrozole only postnatally. Animals receiving vehicle during
the same period were used as controls. Spatial working
memory evaluated in a water maze during puberty (30 days),
was similarly impaired in both males and females treated
pre- and postnatally with anastrozole. Males treated postnatally
with anastrozole showed a poorer performance than
females in this memory task. Stereological quantification of
GFAP-immunoreactive astrocyte numbers in CA1 and CA3
hippocampal subfields showed significant differences for sex
and different treatments with anastrozole. Our results suggest
that organizational effects of gonadal steroids on glial
cells would contribute to the development of sex differences
in spatial memory.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>This study was supported by grant SEJ2004-07445 (Ministerio de Educaci&#x000f3;n y Ciencia, Spain) to JLA.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18419" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF CANNABINOIDS IN CORTEX ON MEMORY PHASES IN CONDITIONED

analyze molecular and pharmacological mechanisms of aversive
learning and memory. When microinfused into the IC
immediately after experiencing the taste conditioned stimulus
(CS) in CTA training, a CB1 agonist, but not antagonist,
reduced subsequent memory. Microinfusion of the agonist
immediately after the first retrieval session following single

blocked the extinction. When rats were trained using
an intensified CTA protocol, which renders the memory
highly resistant to extinction, microinfusion of the agonist
after the first retrieval test led to amnesia of CTA memory.
The antagonist had no effect under these conditions. Our
data support a model in which endogenous occupancy of the
CB1 receptor in IC modulate the hedonic valence of the CS.
These data also promote further investigation of the potential

of higher cognitive function. The validation of a behavioural
task that relies purely on the integrity of the PFC has been
troublesome to date. Temporal order memory is a form of
working memory vital for keeping information on-line in
an ordered format for example in recency discrimination.
We examine the effect of interferon-alpha (IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>) on this
form of working memory in order to provide insights into
the control of goal-directed behaviour. We used a temporalorder
memory object discrimination task where rats are required
to discriminate between two objects on the basis of
recency [<xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Previous research has indicated that the medial
PFC (mPFC) is involved in temporal-order memory, contributing
to the serial organisation of behaviour. It has been
documented that patients treated with IFN<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> therapy suffer
deficits in working memory [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The utilisation of this task to

further insights into the molecular mechanisms that

To investigate its role in fear conditioning consolidation
the neural site was subjected to fully reversible
tetrodotoxin (TTX) inactivation during consolidation in
adult male Wistar rats which had undergone fear training to
acoustic CS and context. TTX was stereotaxically administered
to different groups of rats at increasing intervals after the acquisition session. Memory was assessed as conditioned
freezing duration measured during retention testing, always
performed 72 and 96 hours after TTX administration. Thus
there was no interference with normal NBM function during
either acquisition or retrieval phases. Therefore any amnesic
effect could be due only to consolidation disruption.
The results show that NBM functional integrity is necessary
for contextual fear response mnemonic consolidation up to
the 24-hour after-acquisition delay. On the other hand, NBM
functional integrity was shown to be necessary for memory
consolidation of acoustic CS fear responses only immediately
after acquisition but not at the 24-hour post-acquisition delay.
The present findings help to elucidate the NBM role in
memory consolidation and better define the neural circuits

did not affect preference for novel arm exploration. Zolpidem
(1 &#x00026; 3 mg/kg) decreased entries and distance travelled,
but only attenuated novel armexploration at the higher dose.
Scopolamine was chosen for use in combination studies with
alpha7 nicotinic receptor agonists. Results from these experiments
showed that all three agonists restored preference for
novel armexploration at doses largely corresponding to their
respective ex-vivo [<sup>3</sup>H]-bungarotoxin binding ED<sub>50</sub> values.
In conclusion, the test described here may represent a quick
and simple measure of learning/attentional processing that
avoids the need for extensive training and the use of conventional
reinforcers. The present data also support the idea
that alpha7 nicotinic receptors may represent an interesting
target for the treatment of conditions associated with learning/
attentional dysfunction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18734" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>PROTEASOME-DEPENDENT PROTEIN DEGRADATION IS NECESSARY IN THE CA3 REGION OF

the core mechanisms required for the formation of long-term
memories (LTM). In addition, some studies have reported
that, along with the synthesis of new proteins, the degradation
of proteins is necessary in learning and memory mechanisms
in aplysia (Kandel, 2001)and also in the rat during
passive-avoidance learning, in research that focussed on the
CA1 region of the hippocampus (Lopez-Salon et al., 2001).
In our laboratory, recent studies have reported that another
region of the hippocampus, i.e., the CA3, is crucial for longterm
memory formation, especially for spatial memory (Florian
&#x00026; Roullet, 2004)and that, during consolidation and reconsolidation,
protein synthesis is necessary in this region
(Artinian et al., 2007). Thus, we investigated the role of protein
degradation in the CA3 region of the hippocampus during
spatial memory consolidation. Animals were trained to
locate a hidden platform in the Morris water maze and proteasome
activity was blocked during consolidation. Bilateral
intra-CA3injectionsoflactacystin (50 pmol), an inhibitor of
the proteasome pathway, were infused (0.25 <italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L) immediately
post-acquisition, and retention was tested 24 hours later. Our
results demonstrate that, following lactacystin treatment, animals
were impaired in their ability to retain the precise location
of the platform. Thus, proteasome-dependent protein
degradation is necessary in this region for the consolidation
of spatial memories. The results will also be discussed in relation
to spatial memory reconsolidation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18799" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>SCOPOLAMINE-INDUCED COGNITIVE DEFICIT IN WATER MAZE IN MICE: DOSE-DEPENDENT REVERSAL

occurs in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and is correlated
with the degree of cognitive impairment in AD patients.
Anticholinergic drugs, like scopolamine, can disrupt
short-term or working memory in humans and animals
and are widely used as a pharmacological model to mimic AD in rodents. Cholinesterase inhibitors (ChE-Is) improve
cognitive functions in AD; several of these are approved
for treatment of mild to moderate AD. Rivastigmine,
a ChE-I, inhibits acetyl-cholinesterase activity selectively
in cortex and hippocampus. Nevertheless, no investigations
have been conducted in mice regarding the effect
of different doses of rivastigmine on scopolamine-induced
learning deficit in the reference memory (RM) water maze
paradigm. In the present study, female NMRI mice were
tested for 4 days (6 trials/day) in the RM test and received
2 probes (with no platform in the swimming pool) at
1 and 24 hours post training to assess short- and longterm
memory, respectively. Mice were intra-peritoneally injected
with scopolamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline 35 minutes
prior test and received rivastigmine (0.1, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1
and 4 mg/kg) 5 minutes after the first injection. Reversal
of the scopolamine-induced learning deficit was dosedependent,
being the highest dose (0.5 mg/kg) more efficacious.
Rivastigmine reversed the short-term memory impairment
at the lower doses (0.1 and 0.125 mg/kg), whereas
the long-term memory deficit was reversed at the higher
doses (0.25 and partially at 0.5 mg/kg). Therefore, the
dose range of rivastigmine effective in restoring the learning
or the memory deficit does not necessarily overlap.
Our study provides a more detailed account of the functional
efficacy of rivastigmine in terms of different memory
mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18828" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE NMDA ANTAGONISTS MEMANTINE, SDZ 220,581, PCP AND MK801 PRODUCE DISSOCIABLE PATTERNS

several physiological processes. I.c.v. or intracerebral
injection of aGHR enhances memory and learning. Amygdaloid
body (AMY) plays an important role in the central
mechanisms of the memory and learning processes.
Projections of ghrelinergic neurons were identified in the
AMY, and i.c.v. applied aGHR caused c-Fos overexpression
in the AMY. The aim of the present experiments was to examine
potential effect of intraamygdaloid aGHR on learning.
Male wistar rats were microinjected bilaterally with 50
or 100 ng aGhr, 15 ng GHR receptor antagonist D-Lys3-
GHRP-6 (ANT), ANT + 50 ng aGhr (dissolved in 0.15 M
sterile NaCl /0.4 microlitre) or vehicle into the AMY. In
two-compartment passive avoidance paradigm animals were
shocked with 0.4 mA and subsequently were infused with
the solutions. Latency to enter the dark box was measured.
Fifthy ng aGhr significantly increased the latency time, the
100 ng and the ANT alone were ineffective. The effect of 50 ng
aGHR was eliminated by ANT pretreatment. In separate experiment
effects of 50 ng aGHR, ANT alone and ANT + 50 ng
aGHR were investigated in Morris water maze paradigm after
their bilateral intraamygdalar applications. Injection of
50 ng aGHR significantly reduced latency to find the safe
platform located in one of the quadrants of the maze. Effect
of 50 ng aGHR was inhibited by ANT pretreatment.
ANT alone had no effect. Our results show that the place
learning and the aversive situation linked memory processes
are facilitated by aGHR in the rat AMY. This effect is specific
and mediated by GHR receptors, supported by the resultes
of ANT treatment, but other receptor's role can not be
excluded.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Supported by ETT 317/2006, RET-0008/2005 MEDIPOLIS and by the HAS.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e18944" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DRUG&#x02014;INDUCED DEFICITS IN ACTIVE PLACE AVOIDANCE TASK: EFFECTS ON COGNITION AND

on the basis of the cues predicting reinforcers. There
is evidence to suggest that firing patterns of OFC neurons reflect
the value of a stimulus predicting reward. However, the
transmitter mechanisms underlying the formation of these
predictive firing patterns remain unknown. One candidate
is the glutamatergic neurotransmission system. We recorded
activity from OFC neurons in 2 rats in a familiar environment
using an electrode array holding 14 independently
moveable tetrodes. Additionally, we modified the array to
hold amicrodialysis probe.Used in reversed operation mode,
we unilaterally perfused the OFC during recordings with solutions
of N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA), D-2-Amino-
5-phosphonovalerate (D-APV), lidocaine or aCSF control. A
total of 67 cells was recorded in 4 sessions. Of these, 58 cells
exhibited stable firing patterns during the course of the session
and thus could be considered for analysis. To assess the
effect of the drugs on single unit firing in a resting state, we
calculated mean firing rates over 30 second bins during perfusion
intervals for each cell. Compared to aCSF perfusions,
the perfusion of 0.5 mMNMDA induced a cessation of firing
in 96% of neurons. Perfusion of 2% lidocaine blocked firing
activity in 83% of cells. Finally, perfusion of 0.5 mM D-APV
did not markedly modulate firing rates in any of the recorded
cells but could block the mentioned NMDA effect. These
findings confirm that this array can be used for time-specific
local application of drugs during extracellular recordings in
awake rats. Currently, the effect of D-APV perfusion on single
unit and population activity during a 2- odour discrimination
task is assessed. Pilot results confirm that OFC units
exhibit differential firing patterns to cues predicting the appetitive
and aversive outcome and show reward expectancy
correlates. Results from drug perfusion in 2 rats performing
this task will be presented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e19090" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>AN AUTOMATED PAIRED-ASSOCIATE LEARNING (PAL) TASK THAT USES TOUCH-SENSITIVE MONITORS AND IS SENSITIVE TO MANIPULATIONS OF THE HIPPOCAMPUS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Talpos</surname><given-names>J.

post-mortem, slowing progress in developing effective treatments.
A recent series of studies has shown that a test of
object-in-place paired-associate learning (PAL), as part of
the Cambridge neurological test battery (CaNTaB), is very
effective at predicting whether patients suffering from mild
cognitive disorder (MCI) will go on to develop AD. Previous
research has shown that operant boxes equipped with touchsensitive
computer monitors can be used to study both visual
and spatial discriminations in the rat. Using this technology,
two different PAL tasks were developed: (1) both
the correct and incorrect stimuli are identical objects but located
in different locations (SPAL); and (2) where the correct
and incorrect stimuli are different objects and located in
different locations (DPAL). Rats were trained in each task,
and then underwent bilateral cannulation of the dorsal hippocampus.
After recovery, the Na+ channel blocker lidocaine,
the cholinergic antagonists scopolamine and mecamylamine,
and the glutamatergic antagonists CNQX and MK-
801 were administered prior to testing. Impairments were seen in DPAL, but not SPAL, after the administration of lidocaine
and the glutamatergic antagonists, but not the cholinergic
antagonists. The results presented provide early indication
that DPAL has utility as an automated assay for AD research,
although additional research will be necessary to confirm
this conclusion.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>This work was made possible by a Merck, Sharpe, and Dohme Cambridge Studentship, and a grant to TJB and LMS

from behavior that reflects the remembrance of the content
(what kind of object was presented), place (where was

whether DCS, which is known to enhance learning and

(Gallus gallus). An important aspect of cerebral lateralization
in chicks is the phenomenon of monocular-unihemispheric
sleep (Mo-Un sleep). During normal sleep (binocular: both
eyes closed), chicks have brief periods in which one eye is
open while the other remains shut. The hemisphere contralateral
to the open eye shows an EEG pattern typical of wakefulness
whilst the hemisphere contra-lateral to the closed eye shows an EEG of slow wave sleep. Sleep deprivation seems to
lead to a high need for sleep. We investigated the qualitative
(Mo-Un sleep or binocular sleep) and the quantitative (duration
of binocular and Mo-Un sleep) effects of 8 hours of sleep
deprivation on the pattern of chicks' sleep. Eleven-days old
chicks were divided into two groups: nondeprived (N-DEP)
and deprived 8 hours (DEP-8H). Deprivation of sleep was
obtained by enforced locomotion on a treadmill. After deprivation,
behavioural sleep patterns were recorded for 6 hours
consecutively. The number and duration of episodes of
binocular and Mo-Un sleep were recorded. During the recovery
period, DEP-8H chicks showed an increased time spent
sleeping and had significantly longer episodes of binocular
sleep than N-DEP. Furthermore, NDEP and DEP-8H chicks
showed a reverse pattern of Mo-Un sleep: the former group
showed a bias toward left Mo-Un sleep which is in agreement
with a previous study whilst the latter group showed a bias
toward right Mo-Un sleep. These results suggest that, as reported
in mammals, moderate sleep-deprivation caused a rebound
effect in domestic chicks which seems to be aimed at
sleep recovery but also affected the pattern of Mo-Un sleep.
The reversed pattern shown by deprived chicks may indicate
that there was an extension of sleep recovery in the left hemisphere
because it would be more active during deprivation

environment using geometrical information (i.e., metric
differences among walls and sense for left-right discrimination).
Little is known on the role played by experience on
the ability to use geometric information. Here we took advantage
of the behaviour of a highly precocial species, the domestic
chick (Gallus gallus) to investigate this issue. Soon after
hatching chicks were reared in rectangular-shaped or circularshaped
home-cages. When trained to reorient for food
reinforcement in a rectangular-shaped enclosure, rectangularreared
and circular-reared chicks were identically able to
learn the task. In a second experiment chicks were trained
in a rectangular enclosure with different panels located in
correspondence to each corner, thus providing both geometrical
(the shape of the enclosure) and non-geometrical
(the panels) information. Rectangular-reared and circularreared
chicks were identically able to learn the task. Moreover,
when tested after removal of the panels, circular- and
rectangular-reared chicks were equally capable of using the
residual geometric information available to disambiguate the
task. In a third experiment, after training with the overall arrangement
of panels, chicks were tested after a dislocation
of the panels (affine transformation) so as the previously reinforced
panel was located in a novel, geometrically incorrect,
position. Both rectangular- and circular-reared chicks
resorted more to landmark use when tested in a large enclosure,
whereas they preferred to use geometry when tested
in a small enclosure (see also Chiandetti et al. Anim Cogn
2007); however, no differences were observed between the
two groups. Overall, these results suggest that effective use
of geometric information for spatial reorientation does not
require experience in environments with right angles and
metrically-distinct surfaces.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e19363" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>THE TIMING OF COGNITION: BOLD EFFECTS OF INFERIOR FRONTAL AND SUPERIOR TEMPORAL

play a major role in language processing. Especially the inferior
frontal cortex (IFC) and the superior temporal cortex
(STC) have been investigated with respect to their particular
involvement in language comprehension. In order to get
a deeper insight in the timing of recruitment of languagerelated
brain activation, we have contrasted functional imaging
data of adults and 6-year-old children with a special focus on
BOLD response timelines in these brain regions. Adults and
children differ in latency of their BOLD activation twofold.
First, children show an overall later peak of activation. Second,
in adults IFC activation reveals peak latencies similar
to STC activation, whereas children's IFC activation peaks
much later compared to their STC recruitment. Within the
STC, however, activations in both groups show a similar regionally
bimodal pattern, with fastest peaks in voxels at the
STC's mid-portion around Heschl's gyrus and longer latencies
in anterior and posterior directions suggesting similar
information flow in adults and children in the temporal region.
The observed latency differences in BOLD responses
between children and adults in inferior frontal and superior
temporal areas during language comprehension are in line
with the assumption of a maturational dissociation between
frontal and temporal brain regions. They also support the
view of developmental changes from higher processing costs
in the young brain to faster and more automatic language
processing in the mature brain.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>G-Development, C-Cognition (human).</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e19393" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>NEWBORNS' SENSITIVITY TO BIOLOGICAL MOTION</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bardi</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Di Giorgio</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bulf</surname><given-names>H.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Simion</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>Dipartimento di Psicologia dello Sviluppo e della Socializzazione, University of Padova, Padova, Italy</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Many vertebrates species have primitive neural pathways

that visually inexperienced chicks possess an inborn predisposition
to attend to the pattern of semi-rigid motion shared
by all Vertebrates. No conclusive data were up to now available
for our species concerning the ontogenetic origin of
the well known facilitation observed when biological motion
displays are processed by the visual system. In fact, no
discrimination of biological motion point-light displays was
reported for infants below the age of 3 months leaving unsolved
the question of whether sensitivity to biological motion
is an innate capacity of the human system or is acquired
through experience. Three Experiments were carried out to
test whether newborns are able to discriminate biological
from non-biological displays, and to exhibit a spontaneous
preference for the biological motion display. In addition, we
wondered whether the inversion effect is already present at
birth. A sample of 44 newborn babies aged 44 &#x000b1; 4.7 (Mean

(recognition following habituation) biological vs.
non biological point-light animations (Exp. 1) and, when
first exposed to the displays (spontaneous preference), selectively
prefer to look at the biological motion (Exp. 2). The
biological motion inversion effect seems to be also present at
birth, in fact, babies prefer an upright to an upside-down biological
motion animation (Exp. 3). This data are consistent
with those obtained in other species (i.e., na&#x000ef;ve chicks) and
provide the very first evidence that an inborn mechanism for
the detection and analysis of biological motion is available in

<bold>Aims</bold>: Landau Kleffner syndrome, although rare epileptic encephalopathy,
attract great attention of epileptologists and neuropsychologists because of its dramatic presentation, difficult
treatment and ambiguous outcome. One of the most prominent characteristics of this syndrome is aphasia. The
purpose of this study was to describe characteristics of forms of communication disturbances most frequently seen in
those children.</p><p>
<bold>Method</bold>: Nine children with Landau Kleffner syndrome age 4 and 5 years were assessed. Following tests were used: Reynell Developmental Language Scalesrevised, The Benton Controlled Oral Word Association (COWA) Test, The Boston
Naming Test, The Token Test, The Digit Span subtest of the WAIS-R, and The Auditory-Verbal Learning Test.</p><p>
<bold>Results</bold>: In three children neither expressive nor receptive language was preserved. They expressed global aphasia with no nonverbal communication acts except eye contact. Other six children have characteristics of nonfluent aphasia.
Namely, in three children receptive language in a form of concrete situation understanding is preserved, while expressive
language consists of a few most frequent words. In two children expressive language is almost completely destroyed,
while receptive language is preserved. One child has preserved receptive and expressive language. However, he shows
disturbances at syntactic level both in expressive language.</p><p>

and cognitive deficits, such as phonological and speechrelated
disorders. Mismatch Negativity (MMN) is a preattentive
change-specific component of Event-Related Potentials
(ERPs) occurring in response to infrequent changes in
the physical properties of homogeneous series of sounds. It
has been reported to underlies sensory memory and phonological
competence in newborns and, likewise, to predict cognitive
impairment, such as the aforementioned ones. However,
it has been claimed to vary in amplitude with maturational
and clinical factors like gestational age, but this
relationship is still not well understood. The present study
aims to confirm the presence of this discriminative response
in preterm newborns and to investigate its relationship
with maturational and clinic factors. ERPs were recorded in
&#x0201c;early&#x0201d; (23&#x02013;28 gestational weeks, <italic>N</italic> = 24) and &#x0201c;late&#x0201d; (29&#x02013;34 gestational weeks, <italic>N</italic> = 33) newborns, all tested 35 weeks after
conceptional age. An auditory oddball paradigm was used
with frequently occurring &#x0201c;standard&#x0201d; tones of 1000 Hz and
rarely occurring &#x0201c;deviant&#x0201d; tones of 2000 Hz. Both standardrelated
and deviant-related waveforms, recorded at the midfrontal
location, were analysed. MMN response was present
in all preterm newborns and a Pearsons's correlation showed
its relation with maturational indices like Gestational Age,
Cranial Circumference, Lengths and Weight at birth. Moreover,
a step wise linear regression yielded Gestational Age,
Apgar Index and Intraventricular Haemorrhage as specific
factors explaining MMN amplitudes. Considering the role
of newborns' MMN response in predicting cognitive impairments,
as previous studies have demonstrated, current
findings suggest to take specific maturational and clinical
factors into account in view of using ERPs as a new
tool for prognosis of cerebral dysfunction at a very early
stage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e19729" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DIFFERENTIATION AND MATURATION OF CORTICAL NEURONS IN THE ARCHI- AND NEOCORTEX OF

complications, have a high prevalence of cognitive
and behavioral disturbances that were correlated with the reduced
size of several brain areas including hippocampal formation
and cerebellum. Previously we have shown that morphological
and functional alterations of the preterm brain
cannot be explained with the arrest of neuronal generation
in the dentate gyrus and in the cerebellum (&#x000c1;brah&#x000e1;m et al.,
2004). In the present study we examined the pre-and postnatal
differentiation and maturation of neuronal subtypes containing
calretinin, calbindin and parvalbumin in the temporal
archi-and neocortex. Their distribution and morphology
observed in preterm infants were compared to full-term agematched
controls. Large calretinin-stained cells in layer I of
the cerebral cortex co-expressing reelin and p73 were classified
as Cajal-Retzius cells. Calretinin and calbindin both
appeared early in the fetal period (18th&#x02013;20th gestational
weeks) in the cerebral cortex and were expressed at birth in
an amount and distribution that did not differ in preterms
and in full-term controls. Parvalbumin-positive cells were
detectable only at term, and their appearance and maturation
were also similar in preterms and in full-term infants.
However, the number of Cajal-Retzius cells that play an important
role in the migration of neurons during development
and almost completely disappear from the cortex postnatally,
was significantly higher in the preterms than in their fullterm
controls. Our results suggest that similarly to neuronal proliferation
(&#x000c1;brah&#x000e1;m et al., 2004), expression of calciumbinding
proteins seem to be genetically controlled events and are
not influenced by preterm delivery. In contrast, the postnatal
disappearance of Cajal-Retzius cells might be regulated
by othermechanism that is disturbed following preterm
birth.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>Supported by Hungarian Scientific Research Found Grant # T047109.</p></ack></back></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e19822" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>COMMUNAL NESTING, AN EARLY SOCIAL ENRICHMENT, AFFECTS SOCIAL COMPETENCES AND

brain function and behaviour, we exposed mouse pups to an
early social enrichment: Communal Nest (CN). CN, which
consists in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups
together and share care-giving behaviour from birth to weaning,
mimics the natural ecological niche of the mouse species.
At adulthood, mice reared in CN display higher propensity to
interact socially, more elaborate social skills and higher NGF
and BDNF levels in selected brain areas, when compared
to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions. Homecage
observations, carried out 24/24h for two consecutive
days revealed that, when the hierarchy is established (first
day), CN mice display higher levels of social investigation
behavior. However, when exposed to cage cleaning (second
day), a stimulus challenging social hierarchy, CN mice display
higher levels of offensive behavior. The home-cage findings
show that CN mice display a wider repertoire of social
behaviors and confirm that they have a stronger propensity
to interact with same-sex conspecifics. Furthermore, though
CN mice aremore aggressive, they have elaborate social competences
displaying high levels of aggressive behavior only
when needed to set up their own territory. Overall, these
findings confirm the crucial role played by early social experiences
in shaping adult behavior and suggest a role for
neurotrophins as factors mediating the long-term effects of
experiences on brain function. Support contributed by EU,

on adult (postnatal day 80) rats of both sexes, exposed to the
diet during development. The rats were fed the HF diet from
weaning to adulthood (8-week protocol) or from puberty to
adulthood (4-week protocol). A 1-week protocol, when in
adulthood, was also included in the study. The 8-week diet
protocol enhanced the exploratory behavior of male rats in
the open field, by means of moving, rearing and center crossings,
and the vertical locomotion of female rats. One week of
HF feeding in adulthood increased sniffing in males, but decreased
locomotion in female rats. Notably, the HF protocol
applied from puberty to adulthood did not affect the open
field behavior in either sex. When forced to swim in a glass
cylinder,HF animals of both sexes, in either the 8-week or the
1-week protocol, adopted a less active behavioral response,
by reducing swimming and increasing immobility time. Interestingly,
when HF diet was applied from puberty to adulthood
(4-week protocol), it induced the same as above behavioral
response to swimstress inmales, but had no effect on females.
These data show that fat diet feeding can differentially
affect the behavior of male and female rats. This was particularly
evident during adolescence. In the paradigms used,
young females appear more resistant to fat diet-induced alterations
in behavioral coping with novelty or acute stress.</p></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Supported by the grant 70/3/8320 of the Greek General Secretariat

cognitive functions can contribute to differentiating neglected
children with or without physical abuse compared to
comparison participants; second, to demonstrate the detrimental
impact of children being victimized by a combination
of different types of maltreatment. 129 children aged
6 to 12 years and currently receiving Child Protection Services
because of one of two types of maltreatment (neglect
with physical abuse, <italic>n</italic> = 84; neglect without physical abuse,
<italic>n</italic> = 45) were compared with a control group of 89 children
matched for age, gender and annual family income.
The neuropsychological assessment focused on attention,
and frontal/executive functions. Discriminant analysis identified
auditory attention (Function 1), and frontal/executive
functions (Function 2) as the two sets of variables that most
distinguished the groups. Discriminant analysis predicted
group membership in 61% of the cases. Children who were
neglected with physical abuse showed cognitive deficits in
Function 1 and Function 2. Children who were neglected
without physical abuse differed from the control group in
Function 1. Surprisingly, these same children demonstrated a
greater capacity in Function 2 than the physically abused neglected
and control children. Those results reproduce those
of Nolin &#x00026; Ethier (2007). The present study underscores the
relevance of neuropsychology to maltreatment research. The results support the heterogeneity of cognitive deficits in children
based on different types of maltreatment and the fact
that neglect with physical abuse ismore harmful than neglect
alone.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e19921" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>INTEGRATION OF NEURAL PROGENITORS INTO THE CIRCUITS OF THE NEONATAL BRAIN</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Muzzi</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><xref ref-type="aff" rid="l357">

(DT) of mice of different embryonic ages expressing
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) were transplanted
into the brain of newborn, P7 and adult mice. At different
intervals from transplantation, EGFP+ cells in the
host brains were morphologically and immunohistochemically
characterized, or studied under Electron Microscopy. In
some mice, EGFP+ projection neurons were retrogradely labeled
with FluoroRuby fromthe thalamus. In addition, coronal
brain slices were prepared from 3-week-old mice which
had received EGFP+ cells at P1 and whole-cell voltage- and
current-clamp recordings were obtained from EGFP+ neurons.
EGFP+ cells could be observed in all animals which
underwent a transplantation at P0-P7. Their phenotype was
strictly dependent from where progenitors were dissected:
GE-derived cells were suggestive of interneurons and oligodendrocytes.
DT cells gave a larger variability of phenotypes,
some of which suggestive of pyramidal neurons. EGFP+ neurons
were integrated into the host neural circuits, since they
could be retrogradely labeled from the thalamus, received
synaptic boutons and made synapses with the surrounding
neuropil. Moreover, EGFP+ cells displayed repetitive action
potentials and excitatory synaptic inputs, suggesting they
were functional neurons integrated into synaptic networks.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article id="d35e20053" article-type="abstract"><front-stub><title-group><article-title>DETERMINANTS OF MATERNAL AND INFANTICIDAL BEHAVIOR IN FEMALE MOUSE F1 HYBRIDS</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>W.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>U.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jens</surname><given-names>F.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Orth</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Broad</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keverne</surname><given-names>E.</given-names></name></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fundele</surname><given-names>R.</given-names></name></contrib><aff>University of Uppsala, Sweden</aff></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Mice from one strain of mice and the F1 offspring of different
